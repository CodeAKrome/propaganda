-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text, extract up to 50 entity-relation triplets.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity")
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

3. Format each relationship as ("relationship")

4. Follow the following pattern
- ("source_entity", "target_entity", "relation", "relationship_description")

5. Examples
- ("Sergey Tolchenov", "Russia", "represents", "Sergey Tolchenov is Russia's Ambassador, representing Russia.")
- ("Sergey Tolchenov", "Indonesia", "is_ambassador_to", "Sergey Tolchenov holds the position of Russia's Ambassador to Indonesia.")

6. When finished, output.

7. Place each entity into one of the following types
