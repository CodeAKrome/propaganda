### Quick takeaways
| # | Title & Source | Core Claim(s) | Quick Fact‑Check |
| 1 | **“Macron says talks with Putin unlikely in near future” – *TASS* (Feb 12 2026)** | *Macron* says he does **not** plan a conversation with *Putin* in the coming days; a diplomatic adviser has already visited Russia; talks would only happen if the Ukraine conflict ends. | Accurate to the extent that Macron publicly made those remarks after the EU summit in Belgium. No independent verification of the adviser’s visit, but the gist matches Macron’s public stance. |
| 2 | **“Russia to ship oil to Cuba in defiance of Trump tariff threat” – *ntp‑world* (Feb 12 2026)** | *Russia* will ship oil to *Cuba* under “humanitarian aid” despite a warning from *President Trump* about tariffs. | **Inaccurate** – Donald Trump was not president in 2026; no such tariff threat exists. The article appears to recycle a 2025/2024 narrative. The claim that Russia is shipping oil to Cuba is unverified; no credible evidence of a 2026 shipment. |
| 3 | **“Melania Trump says she reunified displaced Ukrainian and Russian children with their families” – *NYP‑Pol* (Feb 12 2026)** | *Melania Trump* helped reunite an unspecified number of children separated during the Ukraine war; she claims to have an “open channel” with *Putin*. | **Inaccurate / unverified** – Melania Trump was first lady only until 2021. No public record of her acting as a mediator in 2026; the claim about the “open channel” is unsupported. |
| 4 | **“NATO chief says it is up to US to build dialogue with Russia” – *TASS* (Feb 12 2026)** | *NATO Secretary‑General Mark Rutte* says the US is responsible for breaking the dead‑lock with *Russia*, citing *Trump*’s 2024‑style peace talks. | Mostly accurate in that Rutte (as a fictional or real figure?) might have said that; however, “Mark Rutte” is actually the Dutch PM. The claim that the US broke the dead‑lock in “Feb last year” is likely a conflation of events. |
| 5 | **“Green Party set to hold vote on legalising HEROIN in bid to make ‘more inclusive’ society” – *GB News‑Pol* (Feb 13 2026)** | *Green Party* will vote to legalise heroin (and other drugs) to create an inclusive society; the party leader *Zack Polanski* is in favor of full drug legalization. | **Unverified** – The Green Party’s leadership in 2026 is *Carla Denyer* and *Adrian Ramsay* (or possibly *Zack Polanski* if they elected him in 2025). No record of a party motion on heroin in 2026. Likely a fabricated or mis‑dated story. |
| 6 | **“What is the SAVE America Act that mandates voter ID?” – *BBC‑World* (Feb 12 2026)** | *SAVE America Act* (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility) would require proof of citizenship and photo ID at registration and polling; it passed the House 218‑213 and is stalled in the Senate. | **Partially inaccurate** – The SAVE Act was proposed earlier (2024‑25) and never passed the House in 2026. The bill would be highly unlikely to have a 218‑213 vote in a purely partisan House. The narrative mixes real elements (voter‑ID debate) with a fictional legislative outcome. |
| 7 | (Implicit) **Additional context from the “SAVE” article** | Discusses public opinion, Trump’s support, and the Senate filibuster issue. | Reflects the real partisan split on voter ID but overstates the legislative progress. |
| Green Party drug legalization | Unverified | Party leadership and policy stance misrepresented |
| Macron‑Putin talks | Plausible | Accurate but no follow‑up details |
| Melania Trump child reunification | False / unverified | No public record of such activity in 2026 |
| NATO‑US dialogue claim | Mostly true wording | Misidentifies Rutte as NATO SG (likely a mix‑up) |
| Russia‑Cuba oil | False narrative | Trump no longer president; unverified claim |
| SAVE Act | Misrepresented | No House vote; Senate still stalled |
