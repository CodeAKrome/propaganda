Text: HONG KONG, February 13. /TASS/. The United States and Taiwan have signed a mutual trade agreement limiting US duties on Taiwanese goods and granting preferential market access to the island for US industrial and agricultural exports, the Taipei Times newspaper reported.

According to the publication, the rate of US duties on Taiwanese imports will be maintained at 15%, while Taiwanese semiconductors and related goods will receive the most favorable treatment when supplied to the United States. The 15% duty rate corresponds to the rates applied to goods from Washington’s major trading partners, such as Japan, South Korea, and the EU, the newspaper indicated.

Additionally, another 2,072 categories of Taiwanese products will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs and will only be subject to duties in the US under the Most Favored Nation regime. This includes 261 categories of agricultural products, such as Phalaenopsis orchids, tea, starch, coffee, fruit juices, mangoes and several others. These 261 categories account for 42% of the value of Taiwanese agricultural exports to the US, amounting to $374 million annually.

Taiwan, for its part, has agreed to completely eliminate or reduce by 99% tariff barriers on imports of industrial and agricultural products from the US. This list includes automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, seafood, medical goods, wheat, beef, dairy products, pork, lamb, ketchup and peanuts.

This agreement will now be submitted to the legislative body of Taiwan for review and approval.

Taiwan has been governed by its local administration since 1949 when the Kuomintang’s remaining forces headed by Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) were defeated in the Chinese Civil War and took refuge on the island. Taiwan has preserved the flag and several other symbols of the Republic of China that had existed before the Communists took over the mainland. According to China’s official position, which is supported by most countries, including Russia, the Island of Taiwan is one of China’s provinces.

Text: Washington and Taipei have signed a trade deal lowering tariffs on Taiwanese exports to 15%, on par with those on Asian allies Japan and South Korea, while the island will open its market for U.S. goods.

Taiwan will remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide "preferential market access" for U.S. industrial and agricultural exports. These include autos, beef products and minerals.

Taiwan also plans to purchase over $84 billion in U.S. goods from 2025 to 2029, including liquefied natural gas and crude oil, as well as aircraft and power equipment. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that Taiwan had committed to "resolve longstanding non-tariff barriers," such as accepting U.S. vehicles built to U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards without any additional requirements.

This deal was first announced in January when Taiwanese chip and technology companies committed to invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., backed by an equal amount of government credit "to facilitate additional investment by Taiwanese enterprises."

However, Taiwan and the U.S. have shared differing views on chip supply chains.

The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. during U.S. President , Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last month. He also said that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff.

However, Taiwan has pushed back on that proposal, telling Washington that moving 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was "impossible," according to Taipei's top tariff trade negotiator.

Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun told local media that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not simply be relocated.


China, which considers democratically governed Taiwan a part of its territory, had criticized the January agreement, saying that the deal would "only drain Taiwan's economic interests," adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was letting the U.S. "hollow out" the island's key industry.

Chinese President Xi Jinping regards Taiwan's reunification with the mainland "a historical inevitability." Taiwan rejects those claims.

While the U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and is not obligated to defend the island, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act states the U.S. "will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services" as may be necessary to "enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities."

The U.S. in December approved $11.15 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, among its largest deals with the island as it faces growing threats from China, drawing a sharp response from Beijing, with its foreign affairs spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, accusing the U.S. of violating the "one-China principle."

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on China's political purge of military leaders on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: A bipartisan group of senior U.S. lawmakers is urging Taiwan to dramatically boost its defense spending, warning that political gridlock in Taipei risks undermining deterrence as China escalates military pressure around the island.

Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Chris Coons, D-Del., along with Reps. Young Kim, R-Calif., and Ami Bera, D-Calif., sent a letter from 37 lawmakers on Thursday to leaders of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan expressing "serious concerns" that a proposed special defense budget could be only partially funded.

"We hope you will support a robust, multiyear special defense budget… that adequately meet(s) the moment and send(s) a clear signal of Taiwan’s will to defend itself," the lawmakers wrote.

The warning comes as Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, pushes for a major multiyear $40 billion defense package aimed at strengthening the island’s asymmetric warfare capabilities — including missiles, air defense systems, drones and reserve force training — designed to make any Chinese invasion or blockade far more costly.

But the proposal has become entangled in a fierce domestic political battle.

Opposition parties that control Taiwan’s legislature have resisted fully approving the special defense budget, arguing for revisions and greater oversight. The standoff has fueled concern in Washington that delays could weaken Taiwan’s readiness at a time when Beijing is intensifying military operations near the island.

Lai warned in a news conference Wednesday that the opposition's refusal to advance the budget "risks causing the international community to question Taiwan's resolve to defend itself."

Opposition lawmakers have advanced a significantly smaller counterproposal that strips out several capabilities defense officials consider essential to deterring a Chinese attack.

The revised plan would cut President Lai Ching-te’s proposed eight-year special defense budget by nearly 70%, including funding for key U.S. weapons systems, according to Taiwanese officials. Lai has argued that Taiwan cannot afford hesitation as regional tensions grow.

"Today, there is a high degree of international consensus that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are indispensable elements for global security and prosperity," Lai said. "Faced with China's expanding military threats, nations across the Indo-Pacific region are increasing their defense budgets… Taiwan must follow suit."

China's People’s Liberation Army has conducted multiple large-scale exercises around Taiwan in recent months, including drills simulating encirclement and blockade operations. Chinese aircraft routinely cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait and enter Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, while Chinese vessels have increased activity in surrounding waters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping repeatedly has refused to rule out the use of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control.

"The threat posed by the People’s Republic of China against Taiwan has never been greater," the U.S. lawmakers wrote, citing growing military pressure and coercive actions designed to "undermine Taiwan’s will to resist."

The letter also acknowledges mounting frustration in Washington over delays in U.S. weapons deliveries to Taiwan, noting that the United States must address its own "massive backlog" of approved arms sales.

"For our part, the U.S. must address the massive backlog in weapons deliveries to Taiwan," the lawmakers wrote. "You have our commitment… to ensure Taiwan gets the capabilities it needs, faster. Likewise, we need Taiwan to step up with us."

Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. is committed to providing Taiwan with defensive weapons but maintains a policy of "strategic ambiguity" over whether American forces would directly intervene in a conflict.

The budget debate in Taipei now carries outsized geopolitical weight.

Supporters of Lai’s proposal argue that failing to fund the full package could send the wrong signal to Beijing about Taiwan’s resolve. Critics counter that defense spending must be carefully scrutinized and balanced against domestic priorities.

As China continues high-profile military drills around the island, U.S. lawmakers are making clear they believe the moment demands urgency.


"Both the United States and Taiwan must do more to deter PRC aggression," the letter states.

Whether Taiwan’s divided legislature ultimately delivers the funding Lai is seeking could shape not only cross-strait tensions, but Washington’s confidence in the island’s long-term defense posture.

The announcement formalises an agreement unveiled in January to cut US tariffs on many Taiwanese exports.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 07:35 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 02:11 PM

WASHINGTON – The US said on Feb 12 it has signed a deal with Taiwan to confirm lower US tariffs on the island’s goods, alongside Taiwanese spending commitments on American products.

The announcement by the US trade envoy’s office formalises an agreement unveiled in January to

cut US tariffs on many Taiwanese exports

The Feb 12 trade pact, which needs to be reviewed by Taiwan’s legislature, “will eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers facing US exports to Taiwan”, said US Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer.

“This agreement also builds on our longstanding economic and trade relationship with Taiwan and will significantly enhance the resilience of our supply chains, particularly in high-technology sectors,” he added in a statement.

Taiwanese Vice-Premier Cheng Li-chiun said the deal puts Taiwan on a “fair footing to compete with our rivals.”

“Compared with our competitor countries, we have even gained a relative advantage, because the gap created by FTAs that previously left us behind has effectively been closed this time,” Ms Cheng told a press conference in Washington, referring to free trade agreements.

Ms Cheng said Taiwan had secured “Most Favoured Nation” tariff treatment and reduced the average levy “on our exports to the US from an initial 15 per cent, without stacking reciprocal tariffs, further down to an average of 12.33 per cent.”

Taiwan plans to facilitate a “long-term increase in its purchases of important US goods” until 2029, according to a fact sheet released by the USTR’s office.

These include US$44.4 billion (S$56 billion) in liquefied natural gas and crude oil, US$15.2 billion in civil aircraft and engines, as well as US$25.2 billion in power equipment, power grids and other products.

The fact sheet added that Washington has committed to reducing its tariffs on Taiwanese goods, given Taipei’s commitments towards “significant steps to advance a stronger and more reciprocal trade relationship”.

Among other moves, Taiwan committed as well to reducing most tariff barriers and providing preferential market access for US industrial and agriculture exports. AFP

Text: The Trump administration has reached a trade deal with Taiwan, with Taiwan agreeing to remove or reduce 99 per cent of its tariff barriers, the office of the US Trade Representative said.

The agreement comes as the US remains reliant on Taiwan for its production of computer chips, the exporting of which contributed to a trade imbalance of nearly USD 127 billion during the first 11 months of 2025, according to the Census Bureau.

Taiwan’s exports to the US will be taxed at a 15 per cent rate or the US government’s “Most Favoured Nation” rate, the USTR’s office said on Thursday.

The 15 per cent rate is the same as that levied on other US trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Japan and South Korea.

Trade Representative Jamieson Greer attended the signing of the reciprocal agreement, which occurred under the auspices of the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. Taiwan’s Vice Premier Li-chiun Cheng and its government minister Jen-ni Yang also attended the signing.

The deal comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s planned visit to China in April and suggests a deepening economic relationship between the US and Taiwan.

Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy that China claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. Beijing prohibits all countries it has diplomatic relations with – including the US – from having formal ties with Taipei.

Under the deal, Taiwan will make investments of USD 250 billion in the US industries such as computer chips, artificial intelligence applications and energy.

The Taiwanese government says it will provide up to an additional USD 250 billion in credit guarantees to help smaller businesses invest in the US.

The agreement would make it easier for the US to sell autos, pharmaceutical drugs and food products in Taiwan. But the critical component might be that Taiwanese companies would invest in the production of computer chips in the US, possibly helping to ease the trade imbalance.

The investments helped enable the US to reduce its planned tariffs from as much as 32 per cent initially to 15 per cent.

The US side said the deal with Taiwan would help create several “world-class” industrial parks in America in order to help build up domestic manufacturing of advanced technologies such as chips. The Commerce Department in January described it as “a historic trade deal that will drive a massive reshoring of America’s semiconductor sector”.

In return, the US would give preferential treatment to Taiwan regarding the possible tariffs stemming from a Section 232 investigation of the importing of computer chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

TSMC, the chip-making giant, is expected to be the key investor. It has committed to USD 165 billion in investments in the US, including not only fabrication plants but also a major research and development center that would help build a supply chain to power US artificial intelligence ambitions. Major US tech companies such as Nvidia and AMD rely on TSMC for manufacturing highly advanced chips.

Text: Japanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.

The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.

"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled," the fisheries agency said.

The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement.

There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said.

Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a "tiger net fishing boat" with a high capacity.

"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels," Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.

Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.

It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls "reunification".

In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as "egregious", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.

That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.

As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to "stop playing with fire".

Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.

Japan's last two pandas were even returned to China last month.

Zhang Youxia, widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was in January removed from his post.

A woman speaks about how being a transracial adoptee has shaped her life as part of a new podcast.

Japan has been battling sluggish growth, mounting public debt and a rapidly ageing workforce.

A Hong Kong court sentences the 78-year-old British citizen Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison after he was found guilty of national security offences last December.

Lai's supporters say this amounts to a death sentence, but authorities say it demonstrates the rule of law.

Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture, the Fisheries Agency said early Friday.

The incident in the waters off southwestern Japan marks the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat, coming at a time when diplomatic relations between Japan and China have remained strained for months under the leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Zheng Nianli, the 47-year-old Chinese skipper of the fishing boat, was arrested Thursday and stands accused of trying to evade an onboard inspection by a Japanese fisheries control officer about 170 kilometers southwest of the island of Meshima in Goto, Nagasaki.

According to the agency's regional office, the vessel had a crew of 11 and is described as a "tiger net fishing boat," usually known for catching fish such as mackerel and horse mackerel.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a regular press conference on Friday in Tokyo that while an investigation into the case continues, the Japanese government will act "resolutely" through enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal operations by foreign fishing vessels.

The Chinese fishing boat is also the first foreign fishing boat seized by the Japanese Fisheries Agency this year.

The agency conducts onboard inspections and other operations to combat illegal fishing in Japanese waters. Last year, it seized two foreign fishing vessels -- one Taiwanese and one South Korean.

According to its annual report, in 2024 the agency conducted seven onboard inspections, seized a Taiwanese fishing boat and confiscated illegal fishing gear in 18 cases.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

Fishing disputes are one place where Japan can lay down the law without too much blowback. But the ownership of Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is a much more volatile matter that must be handled carefully in order not to push the two countries into a stand-off that neither can back away from.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Hahahaha

In the September 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with a Japan Coast Guard patrol vessel off the coast of the Senkaku Islands (Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture), the Naha District Public Prosecutors Office's decision to release the arrested Chinese captain without further action was reportedly cited as "protecting the Senkaku Islands from China."

In a case where the administration was cozying up to China, then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan and others in the Prime Minister's Office reportedly conveyed their desire to "release" the captain. Former Foreign Minister and House of Representatives member Seiji Maehara also stated that the release was "an instruction from Prime Minister Kan."

It is unusual for prosecutors, who base their work on "law and evidence," to take political factors into consideration, but a prosecutor familiar with the situation at the time said, "The administration lacked the information, equipment, and resolve to protect the Senkaku Islands, and public opinion had not been sufficiently cultivated. Considering the national interest, they could not abandon important territory for the sake of judicial appearances."

Such an approach is unlikely to be taken under the Takaichi administration.

Chinese netizens would be asking for war with Japan now even harder, of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel.  what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

And as my user name says, "NO SUSHI FOR YOU!"

Those were the last words the illegal Chinese captain/fisherman heard from the Japanese Coast Guard after he was detained.

Skip a few episodes. China will leverage rare earths. There’s little Japan can do but that’s for when the wheels come off.

Recently, Japanese media announced with great fanfare the discovery of 16 million tons of rare earth minerals in waters near Minami-Torishima Island, approximately 2,000 kilometers from the mainland, claiming it ranks third globally in reserves.

This so-called "major discovery" was first reported by Japanese media back in 2012, with headlines even more sensational than today's. By 2018, Japan had recycled the same story once again, claiming the rare earths discovered could supply global demand for hundreds of years. Now in 2026, the news has resurfaced yet again, using virtually identical wording from eight years ago.

So no Japan has no rare earths it processes commercially and it would be foolish to replay 2012 with today’s China. Best to get along with your neighbors.

of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

I think there’s some confusion here, so let me clarify a few points.

Okinawa was historically part of the Ryukyu Kingdom, known in  Chinese sources in the Ming as 小琉球國, while Taiwan was referred to as 大琉球國 during parts of the Ming period. The Ryukyu Kingdom had its own distinct political status and tributary relationships, and Taiwan’s status also changed over time, including its annexation by the Qing.

However, Okinawa has not historically been claimed as Chinese territory in the way you’re suggesting. an d neither had Kyushu.

Equating historical naming conventions or tributary ties with formal territorial claims is misleading.

If we’re going to discuss history, we should at least be accurate about the distinctions between tribute relationships, naming, and sovereignty. We should also be honest about claims made by net citizens.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

It was learned on February 6th that after Chinese authorities tightened export controls on dual-use items to Japan in January, they have now approved multiple exports of rare earths to Japan.

China appears to be wary of Japan, the US, and Europe accelerating their efforts to reduce their dependence on China for rare earth procurement.

China should not give in to trivial matters and should stick to its strong policy of banning exports to Japan.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The rule of law being enforced on the high seas. The Chinese fishing boat militia will hate it and go into another meltdown. Just keep watching the behavior guys. Zero need for politics whatsoever when it comes to this stuff.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

spoke too soon about the politics. Our friend Agent Neo deciding to give us this lovely tidbit of timely ‘information’ when it comes to the concept of sea zones and Japans sovereign waters. Just throw it out there like a net and see what swims in.

So the narrative is this. Remember this is after an incident of a ‘fisherman’ being arrested due to IGNORING messages and warnings that he had entered Japans waters illegally.

Don’t like that? Just double down.

Go straight to deny Japans own waters, by suggesting matter of factly that Okinawa now may not be part of Japan after all. They have kindly rewritten history to suit their own agenda. Such a service, the education factor.

Then tying Japan to their nemesis the U.S and rare Earths too as another effort to justify their actions and behaviors, and hopefully net some sympathy with the self hating subsection of our countries. No need to even say which ones at this point either. I’m sure y’all can take a wild guess.

Agent Neo thanks for the insight, love the name too.

What is the Matrix?

The matrix is control.

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

and Guru. Just perfect mate. Marvelously you. Norway and Australia the aggressors. Gurus an Aussie btw folks. Go figure that one out.

Am home in Perth by the way fella! Paradise!

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The people in Taiwan are not an independent ethnic group. They are the Han people who crossed the Straights from mainland China, and they share the same ancestors.

Your conclusion is?

check the ship's bridge and study the equipment and search the compartments, I'm going to bet that this might be a ship under the maritime militia, a paramilitary force under the chinese navy. If not, it's still a good move to do so. But, I can imagine after Takaichi's landslide victory, the Cancel Culture Party's emotional fuse is running short as of late. This incident might just be what's needed to give them another hissy fit.

Good on you, Japan.

Is there any need to ask obvious questions about Taiwan?

It has long been inhabited by Austronesian indigenous people.

In the 16th century, the Portuguese called it "Formosa" (Beautiful Island).

If the indigenous people of Taiwan were of mainland Chinese descent, I wouldn't have any complaints.

But that's not the case.

It began as an island of indigenous people, then passed through the Dutch and Spanish colonial period in the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty, Japan's rule for about 50 years (1895-1945), and finally arrived at the present day Republic of China.

Since it was a colony of the Netherlands, Spain, and Japan, would the Chinese Communist Party recognize any country that claimed it?

Just because Okinawa paid tribute to China doesn't mean it's Chinese territory, of course. Japan also paid tribute to China until the Tang Dynasty.

And unlike Taiwan, Okinawa has never been Chinese territory.

The Senkaku Islands also became an issue after undersea resources were discovered in the 1970s.

Until then, the Chinese Communist Party also treated them as Japanese territory...

The Matrix is ​​"virtual reality." Thanks.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel. what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

Vessels of any nation operating in another nation’s EEZ are subject to boarding, arrest, and seizure.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Water cannons are actually the more extreme response, as smaller vessels, especially those without sealed decks can quickly become waterlogged and sunk.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Not true. Firstly, it's the Coast Guard of the FSB Border Service of Russia.

Secondly, there was one shooting of a crab poacher, clearly in Russian waters, in 2006 after a ramming incident. The previous one before that was way back in 1956, so not "regularly" by any measure. Sensible to apply for a permit.

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

"Chinese won't stay calm"? It's a fishing boat, not a declaration of war. Maybe they should try staying within their own borders instead of worrying about their "calmness" after getting caught red-handed.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

"Economic sanctions and military response" for catching a poacher? That isn’t diplomacy; that’s a temper tantrum.

If the "Chinese people" feel insulted by Japan enforcing its own maritime borders, the problem isn't the arrest—it’s the entitlement. Expecting a sovereign nation to ignore illegal incursions just to soothe your ego is peak arrogance.

Real respect is earned by following international law, not by sending fishing fleets to scavenge in waters that don't belong to you and then playing the victim when you get caught. If you want to avoid "insults," tell your skippers to stay in their own lane.

Text: Japan said it seized a Chinese fishing vessel and arrested its captain for allegedly fleeing inspection in the nation's exclusive economic zone. Here's why that matters.

Japan said it seized a Chinese fishing vessel and arrested its captain for allegedly fleeing inspection in the nation's exclusive economic zone, adding to tensions between the countries.

"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled," Japan's Fisheries Agency said.

Japan said the boat was seized in waters off southwest Nagasaki prefecture. There were 10 more people on board besides the captain.

While ‌Japan ​has seized fishing vessels from South Korea and Taiwan in recent years, the incident is the first ​involving a vessel from China since 2022.

The incident is one that comes against the backdrop of an ongoing diplomatic feud between China and Japan.

The spat began last year in November, after Japan's new conservative leader Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack against Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

Takaichi's comments were much stronger than her predecessors, and China took issue with that. Since then, China has:

Tensions deepened in December, after Tokyo accused Chinese military planes of locking their radar on to Japanese fighter jets near the Okinawa Islands.

There are also longstanding territorial disputes between the two countries, including China's military presence in the disputed Senkaku Islands, which are called Diaoyu in Chinese.

Text: Chinese dictator Xi Jinping sent a video holiday greeting to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Wednesday. In the course of wishing his forces a happy Lunar New Year, he casually confirmed the existence of a Chinese cyberwarfare facility on Fiery Cross Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.

The big revelation came when Xi essentially gave a shout-out to the PLA Cyberspace Force and received a salute in return from the intelligence section chief and Chinese Communist Party political officer stationed on Fiery Cross Reef.

“We shall remain constantly ready for action, resolutely safeguarding our nation’s outpost in the South China Sea,” the section chief chirped.

“Fulfil your assigned duties well, particularly to ensure the coordinated management of soldiers’ work and living conditions,” Xi responded.

The very existence of the Cyberspace Force was not publicly confirmed until last September, when the unit participated in the Victory Day parade in Beijing, China’s annual celebration of victory in World War II. Military analysts believe the Cyberspace Force was formally incorporated as a distinct unit of the PLA in 2024, but it has kept a very low profile until now.

Fiery Cross Reef, which China refers to as Yongshu Jiao, is located in the Spratly Islands, which China calls the Nansha Islands.

Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan also have claims in the Spratlys, but China took the islands and reefs by force in defiance of international tribunal rulings, artificially expanding the smaller features until they were large enough to support permanent installations. Beijing has long claimed these buildings were harmless marine research facilities. Environmentalists say these island-building projects have caused tremendous damage to the local ecosystem.

The equipment showcased by the PLA Cyberspace Force at the 2025 Victory Day parade suggested the unit has a focus on battlefield intelligence and drone countermeasures, which is a disturbing prospect for the hotly contested South China Sea.

Satellite imagery analyzed by the Asia Maritime Transparency Institute (AMTI) in late January showed that China is preparing to militarize another feature in the South China Sea, Antelope Reef in the Paracel Islands. The island chain lies only 250 miles east of the Vietnamese coast and was seized from Vietnam during its 1974 war with China.

AMTI said the installations in the Spratlys and Paracels could be used by China to coordinate its latest instrument of maritime control — fleets of hundreds of fishing boats organized into floating “walls” that can stretch over hundreds of miles. Such barriers could play a role in a prospective Chinese blockade or invasion of Taiwan by disrupting shipping lanes and overwhelming defensive surveillance.

In December, AMTI noted major upgrades to the radar systems installed on Fiery Cross and two other reefs. The think tank warned these upgrades could allow Beijing to “contest the use of the electromagnetic spectrum by others in the event of a conflict.”

Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper, authorities said Friday, in a move likely to further heighten tensions with Beijing.

The episode on Thursday off southern Japan came three months after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled," Japan's fisheries agency said.

Text: Concert tourism is expected be one of the travel industry's more lucrative drivers this year, according to Trip.com, and the upcoming global comeback tour by K-pop group BTS appears to be reinforcing that trend.

Flights and hotel rooms at their tour locations —  in 34 cities across Asia, North and South America, Australia, Europe and the UK, from April 2026 to March 2027 — have sold out just as fast as their concert seats, and spillover tourists are expected to lend an additional income boost to host cities.

Within 48 hours of the tour announcement on Jan. 13, travel searches for South Korean cities Seoul and Busan increased by 155% and 2,375%, respectively, compared with the week before the announcement, according to the travel booking platform Hotels.com.

The momentum's also extended beyond South Korea. In the host city Kaohsiung, Taiwan, searches surged 6,700% year on year during the Nov. 19 tour date, according to another travel agent platform, Booking.com.

Other major tours expected to draw international travel this year include those by Bruno Mars, Harry Styles and K-pop group EXO.

Despite covering more regions than they've ever had and tripling their ticket inventory, BTS' latest tour titled 'Arirang,' sold out in 20 minutes. Their last "Permission to Dance" tour in 2021-2022 sold out in 5-6 hours.

Fans who were unable to complete their purchases due to internet connection issues or poor reflexes during ticket sales have had to resort to the secondhand market.

Resale 'Arirang' ticket prices responded to the voracious appetite of fans, with some tickets featured on the resale platform StubHub going for around $7,276, nearly 40 times the original price, according to checks by CNBC.

Fans also struggled to find suitable accommodations, as high demand fueled price gouging.

Hotel rooms near major transit hubs in South Korea were fully booked on BTS' tour dates, despite some charging more than double typical weekend rates, according to local reports.

Though concert tourists typically travel only to see their idols on stage, their sporadic yet concentrated presence can generate sharp spikes in spending, said Prudence Lai, a consultant at Euromonitor International.

That's because the scarcity of such one-off events, as opposed to the reliability of annual events, creates a "once in a lifetime opportunity" for fans, which drives up demand and makes the industry so lucrative, Event Tickets Center's Chief Marketing Officer, Ben Kruger said.

For comparison, the annual music and arts festival Coachella in California generated roughly half as many web searches as BTS' ticket announcement managed to procure, Kruger noted.

There was a concentrated surge in searches for three- and four-star accommodations close to BTS' concert venues across host cities, according to Hotels.com.

More than just proximity to concert venues, these tourists also consider other factors when choosing an accommodation. Travelers also consider cost, safety and service consistency when booking accommodations, Lai said.

Some hotels are already adjusting to cater to the needs of concert tourists. In Spain, Palace Hotel Madrid has prepared concierge teams to support transportation planning and dining options before and after concerts by BTS and Puerto Rican performer Bad Bunny, whose world tour overlaps in June.

Concertgoers who add a couple of days to their trip, on the other hand, are more akin to "business travelers, adding on a leisure trip after the business trip", Lai said.

She added that as opposed to luxury travelers who want the full-on personalized experience, concertgoers only "want a place to sleep and then go to the concert. So it's a very different type of tourism that we're looking at right now."

Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly lower Friday, tracking Wall Street declines, as fears over artificial intelligence disruption drove the S&P 500 to a third straight day of losses.

Certain pockets of the U.S. stock market have been hit this year by the release of AI tools that threaten automating tasks performed by some companies — or at least risk eating into their profit margins.

Shares of several trucking and logistics firms declined on fears that new AI tools could slash major freight inefficiencies, leading to less demand for the industry's services.

Software stocks like Palantir Technologies and Autodesk also slipped, plagued by disruption worries in recent weeks.

Real estate and financial stocks were also casualties, with commercial real estate brokers extending losses for a second straight day.

Investors in Asia were watching for any spillover effects. Taiwan — among the most prominent market in the AI space — was closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Japanese and Indian IT stocks were down in Asia, with names like Trend Micro and NS Solutions dropping about 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively. In India, Tata Consultancy Services fell 4.6%, while Infosys tumbled 6%.

Chinese tech stocks also fell, with Alibaba down 2.2% and Baidu nearly 4% lower. Tech giant Meituan lost 4.5%

Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.72%, after briefly touching 58,000 on Thursday. The Topix declined 0.92%. Both indexes were dragged by energy stocks.

South Korea's Kospi added 0.31%, the only major index in positive territory, while the small-cap Kosdaq retreated 1.75%.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.69%, weighed down by basic materials stocks, while the mainland CSI 300 lost 0.51%.

Hong Kong-listed Zhipu AI, that trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology, extended its rally on Friday, up 16%, after Thursday's near-30% surge, building on investor enthusiasm around its newly launched open-source GLM-5 model.

MiniMax also added over 11%, extending gains from its last session, as momentum around its updated M2.5 model and enhanced AI agent tools continued to drive buying interest.

Beijing Haizhi Technology Group shares soared over 260% after a $97 million IPO. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was 1.32% down.

Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.34%, led lower by Cisco Systems, which slid 12% after the firm issued disappointing guidance for the current quarter.

The S&P 500 dropped 1.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.03%.

Text: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings has threatened legal action against Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk after Panamanian authorities tapped the group to temporarily take over operations of two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

In a statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison warned A.P. Moller-Maersk that "any steps" the Danish group or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely "result in legal recourse." That's according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese statement.

The simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfires.

After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was "running the Panama Canal," CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port subsidiaries. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  "kowtowing" to American pressure and stalling the transaction.

Tensions intensified last month when Panama's Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a CK Hutchison subsidiary to operate the two ports was "unconstitutional." The company pushed back, saying it "strongly disagreed" with the ruling and launched arbitration proceedings against Panama.

CK Hutchison on Thursday also said it had notified Panama of the dispute under an investment protection treaty, saying it would pursue "all available recourse including additional national and international legal proceedings."

APM Terminals, the Maersk subsidiary asked to take over the ports, reportedly said it was not party to the legal dispute and had only offered to step in temporarily "to mitigate the risks that could affect essential services for regional and global trade."

Maersk shares fell over 3% in Copenhagen on Thursday.

The stakes around Panama ports have risen sharply this year. The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities.

In its strongest rebuke yet, Beijing warned on Wednesday that the Central American country "will inevitably pay a heavy price both politically and economically," unless it changes course. Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the court ruling "logically flawed" and "utterly ridiculous."

China also directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and asked shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week.

The standoff may prove more manageable for Washington than it appears, according to Reva Goujon, a director at advisory firm Rhodium Group. The U.S. retains significant leverage through its treaty with Panama, which could allow it to defend any intervention on national security grounds, she said.

But Beijing has claimed a partial victory, by derailing Washington's initial plans to acquire CK Hutchison's global port holdings outright, Goujon said.

China needs to make the U.S. "clawback in Panama as difficult as possible to avoid setting a precedent," Goujon said, noting that Chinese state-owned shipping giant Cosco's Chancay port in Peru — a key infrastructure investment by Beijing in Latin America — is also in U.S. crosshairs.

The U.S. has raised sovereignty concerns over the port of Chancay, a deep-water facility near Lima. In a post on X on Thursday, the U.S. State Department's bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Peru could be "powerless" to oversee the critical port which was "under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners."

For CK Hutchison, the lawfare will likely end in vein, analysts and law experts told CNBC.

"There's little CK Hutchison can do even with behind-the-scenes support from Beijing," Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors.

Any legal claims — including wrongful interference with property — will ultimately hinge on whether CK Hutchison's port concession is considered "live" or formally terminated, said Shahla Ali, a professor specializing in arbitration laws at the University of Hong Kong.

The duration of Maersk's control over the ports will also be scrutinized, said Ali, who views the recent legal notice as "a deterrent" to keep the door open for further negotiation.

The Panama canal — a crucial trade passage that links the Atlantic and Pacific – handles roughly 40% of all U.S. container traffic each year. CK Hutchison's subsidiary, Panama Ports Co., has operated them since 1997 and received a 25-year agreement renewal in 2021.

The canal was built in the early 20th century by the U.S. which operated it for decades before handing full control to Panama in 1999.

Analysts expected the dispute to drag on, potentially straining U.S.-China relations, already frayed by one year of tariff tensions, Beijing's tightened grip on rare earth exports, disputes over Taiwan and Washington's restrictions on tech exports.

CK Hutchison said Thursday that the continued operation of the two ports "depends solely on actions of the Panama Supreme Court and the Panamanian State," which it cannot control.

TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Manchester City midfielder Yui Hasegawa and Manchester United midfielder Hinata Miyazawa were among the 26 players named Thursday in Japan's squad for the upcoming Women's Asian Cup in Australia, which doubles as a qualifier for next year's World Cup.

Veterans Hasegawa and Miyazawa, who finished as top scorer at the 2023 World Cup despite Nadeshiko Japan being knocked out in the quarterfinals by Sweden, were joined in the squad by London City Lionesses defender Saki Kumagai, who has played 164 times for her country.

Only four of the 26 players were selected from Japan's domestic WE League, while 22 play for clubs in Europe or the United States.

At a news conference announcing the squad in Tokyo, manager Nils Nielsen expressed hope of securing the team's third Asian Cup title and a 10th consecutive World Cup appearance.

The Asian Cup, which kicks off on March 1, features 12 teams divided into three groups of four, with the knockout stage beginning at the quarterfinals.

Japan, ranked eighth in the FIFA rankings, will face 40th-ranked Taiwan, 67th-ranked India and 36th-ranked Vietnam in Group C.

The top six teams will qualify directly for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, while two more will advance to the inter-confederation playoffs.
