Text: The official X account of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace announced on Thursday that Israel has joined the international organization as a founding member.

With that, Israel is now among 27 other countries that are members of the Council: the United States, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Paraguay, Pakistan, Morocco, Mongolia, Kuwait, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Indonesia, Hungary, Egypt, El Salvador, Cambodia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Bahrain, Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Argentina.

The Board of Peace officially launched its account on X in late January. Its only posts so far have been to welcome the member countries.

The Board of Peace, which was founded as part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, had been launched the previous week in a special ceremony led by Trump during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

A week before that, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he has accepted Trump’s invitation and will join the initiative.

Despite Israel now being an official member, the Prime Minister's Office announced earlier on Thursday that Netanyahu will not be attending the first meeting of the Board of Peace, which is scheduled for next week in Washington. Netanyahu has just returned from Washington, where he met at the White House with Trump.

Text: Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weisz is  a member of the Council of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.

Nearly two years after October 7, Israel is still at war. There is no clear resolution in sight. As these lines are written, Israel’s Prime Minister is in the United States, having met with President Trump, while public discussion is filled with warnings about the most serious possibilities ahead, including the real danger of a renewed and expanded war with Iran. Stability has not yet returned. Peace has not yet been reached.

In this atmosphere, there is an ongoing debate about “the day after" - what Israel should look like once the war finally ends. Some argue that it is essential to plan now for what comes next. Others insist that it is premature to focus on the aftermath while the war itself is still unfolding.

But there is a basic truth that must not be overlooked: for many people, the day after has already arrived.

For those who were killed al kiddush Hashem, the war is over. For their parents, spouses, and children, life has changed permanently. They are now bereaved parents, widows and orphans. They are not engaged in abstract discussions about future policy or long-term strategy. They are living with a loss that cannot be undone.

Parashat Mishpatim speaks directly to this reality. The Torah does not deal only with historic moments or national decisions. It focuses on daily responsibility - on how Jews are expected to behave in the middle of crisis, especially toward those who are vulnerable and in pain.

The Torah states:

כׇּל־אַלְמָנָה וְיָתוֹם לֹא תְעַנּוּן“You shall not afflict any widow or orphan."(Shemot 22:21)

Rashi explains:

כׇּל אַלְמָנָה וְיָתוֹם לֹא תְעַנּוּן - הוּא הַדִּין לְכָל אָדָם, אֶלָּא שֶׁדִּבֵּר הַכָּתוּב בַּהוֹוֶה, לְפִי שֶׁהֵם תְּשׁוּשֵׁי כֹּחַ וְדָבָר מָצוּי לְעַנּוֹתָם(Rashi to Shemot 22:21, based on the Mechilta)

This means that the prohibition applies to all people, but the Torah singles out widows and orphans because they are weakened and especially vulnerable to being hurt.

The Mechilta adds a crucial point. What defines “affliction" is not what the speaker intended, nor what they believe to be reasonable. The standard is how the other person experiences it.

אִם עַנֵּה תְעַנֶּה אֹתוֹ - אֶחָד עִנּוּי מְרֻבֶּה וְאֶחָד עִנּוּי מוּעָט(Mechilta d’Rabbi Yishmael, Masechta d’Nezikin 18)

Whether the pain caused is great or small, it is still considered affliction.

This teaching is painfully relevant today. Conversations about “the day after" may be necessary and well intentioned. But when such discussions take place in the presence of those already living with loss, they can deepen pain, even when no harm was meant.

The Mechilta records a striking exchange:

כְּבָר הָיָה רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן יוֹצְאִין לֵהָרֵג…אָמַר לוֹ רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל: מִיָּמֶיךָ לֹא בָא אָדָם אֶצְלָךְ לָדִין אוֹ לִשְׁאֵלָה, וְשִׁהִיתּוֹ עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי גּוֹמֵא כּוֹסָךְ, עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי נוֹעֵל סַנְדָּלָךְ, אוֹ עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי עוֹטֵף טַלֵּיתָךְ?וְאָמְרָה הַתּוֹרָה: “אִם עַנֵּה תְעַנֶּה אֹתוֹ."אָמַר לוֹ: נִחַמְתָּנִי רַבִּי.(Mechilta d’Rabbi Yishmael, Nezikin 18)

Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Shimon whether he had ever delayed someone who came to him for judgment or guidance while finishing a drink, tying his shoes, or wrapping his tallit. The Torah teaches that even such a delay can be considered affliction. Rabbi Shimon responded, “You have comforted me, my teacher."

Even actions that seem small or insignificant can cause real pain to someone who is already vulnerable.

The Gemara in Shabbat presents a related story:

רַב יְהוּדָה הֲוָה יָתֵיב קַמֵּיהּ דִּשְׁמוּאֵל… אֲתַאי הַהִיא אִיתְּתָא קָא צָוְוחָה קַמֵּיהּ, וְלָא הֲוָה מַשְׁגַּח בַּהּ.אָמַר לֵיהּ: “אוֹטֵם אָזְנוֹ מִזַּעֲקַת דַּל - גַּם הוּא יִקְרָא וְלֹא יֵעָנֶה."(Shabbat 55a)

A woman cried out before Shmuel, and he did not respond. Rav Yehuda challenged him by quoting the verse: “One who closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself cry and not be answered."

The Gemara does not explicitly rule who was right in that moment. But Tosafot, drawing on a tradition from the Geonim transmitted by Rabbeinu Chananel, offers a striking conclusion based on another Gemara.

The Gemara in Bava Batra teaches:

עוֹלָם הָפוּךְ רָאִיתִי - עֶלְיוֹנִים לְמַטָּה וְתַחְתּוֹנִים לְמַעְלָה(Bava Batra 10b)

“I saw a reversed world - those considered elevated here were lower there, and those considered low here were higher."

Tosafot add:

וּבְאוֹתוֹ עוֹלָם רָאָה שְׁמוּאֵל תַּחַת רַב יְהוּדָה, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוֹכִיחוֹ עַל שֶׁלֹּא הִטָּה אָזְנוֹ לִזְעַקַת הָאִשָּׁה(Tosafot to Bava Batra 10b)

In the World of Truth, Shmuel stood beneath Rav Yehuda, because Rav Yehuda rebuked him for not listening to the woman’s cry.

One moment of moral clarity - seeing and responding to human pain - outweighed years of Torah instruction.

The Gemara further states:

הֲרוּגֵי מַלְכוּת - אֵין כׇּל בְּרִיָּה יְכוֹלָה לַעֲמוֹד בִּמְחִיצָתָן(Pesachim 50a; Bava Batra 10b)

Those killed by the ruling power - no one can stand in their place.

The Rambam rules:

אֵלּוּ הֲרוּגֵי מַלְכוּת - זָכוּ לְחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא בְּלֹא מִצְוֹת מַעֲשִׂיּוֹת(Rambam, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:6)

Those killed by the [foreign] government merit the World to Come even without accumulated mitzvot.

This category includes soldiers and victims of terror who were killed by enemies of Israel.

Parashat Mishpatim reminds us that before political debate, before long-term planning, and before discussions about “the day after," there is a basic mitzvah that cannot be set aside. Not to cause additional pain. Not to ignore those who are crying out. Not to speak over people who are mourning.

We cannot undo what has been lost. We cannot remove the pain. But we are commanded not to add to it.

The Torah does not ask us to predict the future. It asks us to act correctly in the present. While leaders debate strategies and analysts speak about what comes next, Parashat Mishpatim reminds us that the test of a Jewish society is not how it plans for “the day after," but how it treats those for whom that day has already arrived. In times of war and uncertainty, our first obligation is not to explain, justify, or move on - but to listen, to carry responsibility, and to ensure that no additional pain is caused by our words or our silence.

Text: Alex Traiman is the CEO and Jerusalem bureau chief of the Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) and host of “Jerusalem Minute." A seasoned Israeli journalist, documentary filmmaker and startup consultant, he is an expert on Israeli politics and U.S.-Israel relations. A former NCAA champion fencer and Yeshiva University Sports Hall of Fame member, he made aliyah in 2004, and lives in Jerusalem with his wife and five children.

(JNS) On the face of it, it may appear that the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t go as well as the latter may have hoped.

Netanyahu was not greeted at the West Wing entrance by Trump in front of waiting cameras, as he had been before. There were no pre-meeting or post-meeting press opportunities. Typically, such pressers are loaded with big grins and mutual platitudes, in addition to substance.

And it’s hard to know whether the three-hour meeting, which went much longer than planned, was filled with consensus. Yet with these two leaders, public appearances may be intentional projections designed to camouflage future intentions.

While no details were released as to what took place, there was much on the table to discuss. Netanyahu reportedly shared Israeli intelligence regarding Iranian nuclear development, ballistic-missile production and the massacre of Iranian protesters-all designed to demonstrate that Iran is violating each and every one of America and Israel’s collective red lines.

Focusing on the nuclear program

Yet Trump continues to insist on negotiating with the Islamic Republic and centering negotiations on its nuclear program. In a post on Truth Social immediately following his meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump wrote: “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a deal can be consummated. If it can, I let the prime minister know that will be a preference."

From one point of view, it is difficult to understand why Trump would enter any negotiations at this point, barely six months after Jerusalem and Washington used 12 days of penetrating air power to destroy Iran’s known nuclear facilities.

Just six weeks ago, during the last Trump-Netanyahu meeting in Mar-a-Lago, Trump told reporters that the United States would act quickly with military force if it could be proven that Tehran was attempting to restart its nuclear program.

Furthermore, Trump announced weeks ago to protesters being mowed down in the streets in the tens of thousands by the Islamic regime’s brutal forces that “help is on the way." Many assumed that help would come in the form of forthcoming military intervention.

The president has since paused referring to Iranian citizens, and instead has been focusing his comments squarely on Iran’s nuclear program and ballistic missiles, insisting that a negotiated settlement is his preferred course of action.

The art of a nuclear deal

Trump, a master negotiator and author of the best-seller, The Art of the Deal, is well aware of what a good deal or a bad deal looks like.

In May 2018, during his first administration, he withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal-officially the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that former President Barack Obama signed in 2015. Trump recently called that one of the “worst deals" ever brokered.

Trump is intrinsically aware that Iran’s goal in negotiating is to stall and try to strengthen its dramatically weakened strategic and even military position. Still, any deal the present regime enters would not be worth the paper it’s printed on.

Iran is a signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. That didn’t prevent it from developing a sophisticated illicit nuclear-weapons program.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Netanyahu appear to be on the same page about what successful negotiations in 2026 must guarantee: no nuclear enrichment or weaponization; strict limits on ballistic missiles; no funding of foreign terror proxies in the Middle East or beyond; and no mass murder of Iranian protesters.

Maximum leverage

Trump is banking that by applying maximum leverage on the Islamic Republic, he can extract maximum concessions. Trump has mobilized a “massive armada" that sits as a sword of Damocles over Iran’s head. And he has demonstrated that under his leadership, the United States is no paper tiger and not afraid to strike in Iran at nuclear facilities or senior leaders.

Back in January 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Baghdad. The strike reportedly shook Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the core. Less than a year ago, Trump pleaded with Iran, without success, to negotiate its nuclear program.

In his post on Truth Social immediately following his meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump wrote: “Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a deal, and they were hit with ‘Midnight Hammer.’ That did not work well for them. Hopefully, this time they will be more reasonable and responsible."

Trump’s Achilles’ heel

Yet by entering any deal, Iran’s goal will be to buy time to live another day, wait out the Trump presidency, and ultimately, take advantage of the West after a new president is in office.

From Israel’s perspective, this is the major Achilles’ heel of the U.S. president’s Middle East policy.

Acting benevolently toward malign actors, such as Syria’s Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, may yield short-term benefits and relative calm for Washington. Trump should genuinely be trusted when he tells Netanyahu that he will personally intervene if Erdoğan threatens Israel’s security.

The problem is that, unlike Middle Eastern dictators, many of whom reign for decades, Trump has barely three years remaining in office.

There is a strong chance that any future president, like so many of Trump’s predecessors, will be significantly more likely to be taken advantage of by despots. This is particularly true if the next president is a left-wing progressive or a right-wing isolationist.

Further, if the political pendulum swings in the next presidential election, there are no guarantees that a future president would not outright cancel any deal that Trump reaches, just as Trump withdrew from Obama’s JCPOA.

The ultimate deal: Exile of Khamenei

Trump may now be trying to broker the ultimate deal, including guarantees that Iran would meet America’s requirements to cease any nuclear enrichment, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and state sponsorship of terror proxies.

In reality, the only negotiated outcome that could be trusted to achieve these results would be the exile of Khamenei, the mullahs and other upper echelons of his regime.

When longtime Syrian President Bashar Assad lost control of his military forces and his country, he chose to live in exile rather than be killed and fled to Moscow. Trump reportedly offered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro an exile off-ramp to Turkey that he refused before he was arrested on Jan. 3 by U.S. forces.

For Khamenei to accept exile, he would need to recognize that his rule would soon end by force if he refused to go. Yet that strategy assumes that at the end of the day, the 86-year-old theocrat is a rational actor.

Khamenei is neither a president nor a king. He is an ayatollah, guided by a fundamentalist and messianic ideology, who has demonstrated his willingness to wreak havoc across the Middle East. Accordingly, one must gauge that he may strike with every weapon at his disposal toward every viable target, even if his capabilities pale in comparison to the military capabilities of America or Israel.

Striking Iran would likely set off a series of retaliations across the region, potentially jump-starting a larger war. And that could pull the United States into it, too. Under the “Declarations of War Act," an extended military campaign could require congressional approval, a process Trump would prefer to avoid. By contrast, congressional approval is not necessarily required for isolated, targeted operations like “Midnight Hammer" to bomb the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear complexes, or “Operation Absolute Resolve" to remove Maduro.

‘Up to the Iranian people’

It has been reported that Trump would prefer not to be associated with assassinating Khamenei, even though Iran allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump.

Speaking to reporters this week, Vance stated, “If the Iranian people want to overthrow the regime, that’s up to the Iranian people."

Coming off a successful special forces operation to remove Maduro from Venezuela barely one month ago, and with Cuba now teetering on the brink of collapse, Trump would prefer that any regime change in Iran occur without American military intervention.

The president does not want to cement a reputation of foisting regime changes by force around the world, as bad and as anti-American as these regimes may be. Instead, he seeks to use his own skills to out-negotiate a people known for their own prowess at the negotiation table.

In 2020, Trump posted on X that “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"

Vance said this week that “the president has told his entire senior team that we should be trying to cut a deal that ensures the Iranians don’t have a nuclear weapon. But if we can’t cut that deal, then there’s another option on the table. The president is going to continue to preserve his options."

Netanyahu’s longtime strategy

The Israeli prime minister himself is a master strategist who has managed a seven-front war, alongside diplomatic and domestic challenges, with wisdom, temerity and resolve. In the past year, he has outflanked his adversary Khamenei and worked exceptionally well with Trump, his friend and ally. As a result, Iran’s entire terror proxy network has been weakened; its ballistic-missile stockpile and launching capabilities have been reduced to less than half of their original strength; and its nuclear program is in a shambles.

Before last June and Israel’s 12-day war, Trump used the threat of Israeli military action as his leverage in failed attempts to negotiate the end to Iran’s nuclear program. He was only to hold Israel off for so long before Netanyahu ordered the Israel Air Force to take matters into their own hands and strike at Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.

Once again, Netanyahu reportedly seeks to maintain the freedom of Israeli operations against Iran, regardless of whether Trump signs any negotiated deal. An American document need not bind Israel.

So while on the outset, it may appear that he did not achieve what he had hoped-to immediately convince Trump that negotiations with Iran are doomed to fail-the likelihood that Trump will enter a bad deal remains slim.

With this meeting, Trump is fully aware of Israel’s position. He is also fully aware of what a Middle East without fundamentalist ayatollahs will mean for the entire region and the world.

Similarly, as they did just before the 12-day war last June, Trump and Netanyahu may have agreed on a set timetable for negotiations, after which a military option can be initiated. Iran is likely now on the clock to make a deal.

No one knows right now if Trump’s statements represent the actual outcome of the meeting. It wouldn’t be the first time that Trump and Netanyahu have used misdirection to foil Khamenei. It was obviously strategic that the two leaders opted not to speak to the press during or after their conversation.

Yet even if this meeting did not set the terms and target for a joint U.S.-Israel war with Iran, it remains almost certain that the next one will.

Text: Austria and Germany have joined France in calling for the resignation of United Nations Special Rapporteur for the "Occupied Palestinian Territories" Francesca Albanese following her recent remarks calling Israel the "common enemy of humanity."

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul condemned Albanese’s statements.

“I respect the system of independent UN rapporteurs. However, Ms. Albanese has repeatedly made outbursts in the past. I condemn her recent statements about Israel. She is untenable in her position," Wadephul said.

Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger likewise criticized the Special Rapporteur.

"Francesca Albanese broadly brands Israel as an ‘enemy of humanity.’ Criticism of Israel’s conduct is legitimate, and Austria has always called for compliance with international law. But Albanese is spreading incitement. Such language undermines the impartiality and highest standards required of a UN representative. Ms. Albanese has unfortunately repeatedly failed to meet these standards," Meinl-Reisinger stated.

The French government previously called for Albanese to step down after she stated that Israel is the "common enemy" of humankind. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers that France "unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks made by Ms. Francesca Albanese, which are directed not at the Israeli government, whose policies may be criticized, but at Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable."

Barrot said Albanese's remarks "add to a long list of scandalous positions, justifying October 7, the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust, mentioning the Jewish lobby or comparing Israel to the Third Reich." More than 20 French MPs demanded that Albanese be removed from her position following her remarks at an Al Jazeera conference.

In remarks delivered at the Al Jazeera conference, Albanese said: “The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support ... We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy."

Text: TEL AVIV, February 13. /TASS/. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he is considering a proposal from his US counterpart Donald Trump to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but has not yet made a decision on the matter yet.

"President Herzog deeply appreciates President Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state governed by the rule of law. Contrary to the impression created by President Trump’s remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on this matter," the president’s office said.

In June 2025, Trump called for an end to Netanyahu’s trial in Israel, describing it as a mockery of justice. On October 13, during a speech at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, Trump addressed Herzog and proposed pardoning the prime minister. On November 12, the Kan public broadcaster reported that Herzog had received an official letter from Trump proposing a pardon for Netanyahu. On November 30, Netanyahu submitted a request for a pardon to the president through his lawyer.

Netanyahu is charged with three counts of corruption, including receiving illegal gifts worth more than 700,000 shekels, or about $213,000, including cigars and champagne. He is also accused of fraudulently regulating the media in exchange for favorable coverage of his activities and of bribery to promote projects in the interests of his friends. The trial began in 2020 in the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem courts, and Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the charges.

In December 2024, the prime minister began testifying in court, but the hearings have since been repeatedly interrupted, canceled, or postponed for various reasons.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Mr Benjamin Netanyahu has been a great wartime prime minister.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 06:45 AM


WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Feb 12 that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should receive a pardon for corruption charges, saying Israeli President Isaac Herzog should be “ashamed of himself” for not granting one.

Mr Trump said Mr Netanyahu has been a great wartime prime minister and that the Israeli people should shame Mr Herzog for not pardoning him.

“He’s disgraceful for not giving it. He should give it,” Mr Trump said during a White House event.

Mr

Netanyahu met Mr Trump in Washington

Mr Netanyahu is Israel’s first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime and denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges dating back to his 2019 indictment.

Mr Trump has publicly urged the Israeli president to pardon Mr Netanyahu several times, and said in late December that Mr Herzog had told him the pardon was on its way. Mr Herzog’s office was quick to dispute it.

Under Israeli law, the president has the authority to pardon convicts. But there is no precedent for issuing a pardon mid-trial.

In response to queries about Mr Trump’s comment, Mr Herzog’s office said Mr Netanyahu’s request was under review at the Israeli Ministry of Justice for a legal opinion, and once that process was completed, Mr Herzog would consider the request.

“Israel is a sovereign state governed by the rule of law. Contrary to the impression created by President Trump’s remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on this matter,” Mr Herzog’s office said. REUTERS

Text: TEL AVIV, February 12. /TASS/. Circumstances could be created for reaching a good agreement between the United States and Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated before departing from Washington, where he had met with White House host Donald Trump the previous day.

"A number of issues were discussed, but in fact, the meeting was focused on the negotiations with Iran. I think that the circumstances he [Trump - TASS] is creating can create the conditions for achieving a good agreement [with Tehran]," Netanyahu stated.

Netanyahu’s remarks, disseminated by his office, mentioned that during the meeting with Trump, the prime minister "expressed general skepticism regarding the nature of any agreement with Iran," but "said that if an agreement is indeed reached, it must include elements that are extremely important for Israel." "This concerns not only the nuclear program. It also concerns ballistic missiles and Iran’s proxies [in the region]," he explained.

The Israeli prime minister added that "Gaza and the entire region" were also touched upon during the conversation.

Fox News' "Antisemitism Exposed" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

- NYC antisemitic incidents nearly triple despite other crimes reaching record lows- Pennsylvania Democrat slams antisemitic rally glorifying Hamas- Writer sees red over Robert Kraft's Blue Square Alliance Super Bowl ad

TOP STORY: While NYC celebrated its "safest January ever" with record-low murders and shootings, anti-Jewish hate crimes skyrocketed 182%. Accounting for over half of all hate crimes, these 31 incidents—including a Chabad headquarters ramming—have the community on edge. As overall crime dips, the ADL is demanding Mayor Mamdani prioritize leadership to confront this "staggering" surge in targeted violence.

VIDEO: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro talks collaboration with federal authorities on crime, concerns over rising antisemitism on both sides of the aisle on 'Special Report.’ WATCH HERE:

'I FELT COMPELLED': State Senator Sharif Street, the chamber’s first Muslim member, forcefully condemned an antisemitic Rittenhouse Square rally where protesters glorified Hamas and "martyrdom." Rejecting extremism, Street declared that Hamas should be condemned, not celebrated. His stance joins a bipartisan chorus, including GOP leaders and Governor Shapiro, warning that inciting violence against Jewish neighbors destroys the path toward peace.

NOT A FAN: New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft’s "Sticky Note" Super Bowl campaign against antisemitism is under fire. Tablet columnist Liel Leibovitz slammed the ad as "idiotic" and "spineless clicktivism," comparing it to empty moral posturing. He argues the soft approach fails to address real-world threats, demanding tougher, more direct action over symbolic blue squares.

GUEST EDITORIAL: Arbel Yehoud and Ariel Cunio, who were taken hostage from Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, write about how their deep love for one another helped them survive the ordeal.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: "But the new ad is so offensive, not only because it blows—or because, in reality, prominent American Muslims have spent the past three years acting very un-Bilal-like and drumming up everything from modern-day blood libels to violent antisemitic pint-sized pogroms on college campuses—but also because of what it tells us about the mindset of so much of organized Judaism these days." Tablet columnist Liel Leibovitz on Robert Kraft's Super Bowl ad.

Text: A woman in her 50s was shot dead on Thursday evening at her home in Tamra in northern Israel, apparently by a stray bullet fired at the building.

Paramedics who arrived at the scene found the woman with severe injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Preliminary investigations suggest that she was not the intended target, but was hit by the deadly gunfire while at home.

Earlier on Thursday, a 24-year-old woman was moderately injured in Tayibe. Surveillance footage shows a masked gunman attacking her car and firing at her from close range. In a display of quick thinking, the young woman managed to leap from the passenger seat and escape to a nearby store, bleeding.

In the past 24 hours, five other people have been murdered. A young man, around 20 years old, was shot dead in Segev Shalom in the Negev, and three others were killed in Rahat, Yarka, and Lod.

In another incident, a man was shot dead in Fureidis, near Zichron Yaakov, and the incident was accompanied by clashes between residents and police at the scene.

Since the beginning of 2026, there have been 45 murders in 43 days in the Arab community, 17 more than during the corresponding period last year, when 28 murders were recorded.

U.S. President Donald Trump points his finger towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they shake hands during a press conference after meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., December 29, 2025. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Published Feb 13, 2026, 01:46 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 01:50 AM

JERUSALEM, Feb 12 - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said he hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump was creating the conditions to reach a deal with Iran that would avoid military action.

Netanyahu, who met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, said he had expressed "general scepticism" and said that if an agreement was reached, "it must include the elements that are very important to Israel."

They include a halt to Iran's nuclear programme, limits on its ballistic missiles and Iran’s proxies, he added.

Wednesday's meeting was the seventh between Trump and Netanyahu since Trump returned to office last year. Netanyahu - whose visit was more muted than usual and closed to the press - was looking to influence the next round of U.S. discussions with Iran following nuclear negotiations held in Oman last Friday.

The two leaders spoke behind closed doors for more than two-and-a-half hours in what Trump described as a "very good meeting".

But the U.S. president said no major decisions were made and stopped short of publicly accepting Netanyahu's entreaties.

"We have a very close, very genuine, and very open relationship," Netanyahu said, noting the discussions focused on several issues, but primarily on the negotiations with Iran, and Trump wanted to "hear my opinion."

"The President believes that the Iranians have already learned who they are dealing with," he said. "I think that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time by not reaching an agreement, may create the circumstances for achieving a good deal."

The African Union's peace and security organ on Thursday condemned Israel's recognition of Somaliland, calling it an affront to Somalia's sovereignty.

In a communique on Thursday, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) said it strongly rejected the unilateral recognition of the "so-called Republic of Somaliland" by Israel, and called for 'its immediate revocation'.

The statement follows Israel's announcement on Dec, 26 of last year that it had officially recognized Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, becoming the sole country to do so.

The move was condemned by the African Union and nearly all Arab countries.

Somalia has since canceled a military agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the owners of Berbera port in Somaliland.

Mogadishu has also signed defence agreements with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and welcomed the deployment of Turkish fighter jets on its soil.

Text: World Jewish Congress (WJC) President Ronald S. Lauder on Thursday called for the removal of UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, joining a growing list of those who have called for her removal due to her constant anti-Israel statements.

In a statement ahead of his attendance at this week’s Munich Security Conference, Lauder said, “Amid growing geopolitical turbulence and a disturbing rise in antisemitism, it is essential that world leaders stand firmly behind US President Donald J. Trump’s initiatives to promote stability, ensure the safety of the Jewish people, and advance peace."

“Key among these is the recent sanctioning of UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, a dangerous figure who continues to use her position to promote discredited conspiracy theories, divisive and antisemitic narratives, and who represents an extremist ideological agenda rather than that of the United Nations," added the WJC President.

“As I meet with leaders in Munich and in the weeks ahead, I will advocate for a clear moral line to be drawn. Individuals such as Ms. Albanese must be removed from the UN before more damage can be done to the Jewish people - and the institution’s mission," he concluded.

Earlier on Thursday, Austria and Germany called for the resignation of Albanese following her recent remarks calling Israel the "common enemy of humanity."

The French government previously called for Albanese to step down over the remarks. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers that France "unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks made by Ms. Francesca Albanese, which are directed not at the Israeli government, whose policies may be criticized, but at Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable."

The calls for her removal follow remarks delivered at the Al Jazeera conference, in which Albanese had said: “The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support ... We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy."


Albanese’s history of anti-Israel statements and actions is well-documented and dates back to social media posts uncovered in 2022, in which she claimed that the “Jewish lobby" controls the US.

At the time, Albanese rejected arguments that the comments about the “Jewish lobby" were antisemitic and claimed they were “mischaracterized", but her anti-Israel bias has continued to be exposed since.

Her criticism of Israel has grown since Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack in Israel. The attack, in which Hamas terrorists killed over 1,200 people and took 250 hostages, was described by Albanese as an act that must be viewed in “context" and as a response to Israeli “aggression."

She has also in recent months accused Israel of genocide, likened the Government of Israel to the “Third Reich," and compared Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran Thursday with "very traumatic" consequences if it fails to make a nuclear deal -- but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was skeptical about the quality of any such agreement.

Speaking a day after he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said he hoped for a result "over the next month" from Washington's negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.

"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters. "This will be very traumatic for Iran if they don't make a deal."

Trump -- who is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to pressure Iran -- recalled the U.S. military strikes he ordered on Tehran's nuclear facilities during Israel's 12-day war with Iran in July last year.

"We'll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can't, we'll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them," Trump said.

Netanyahu had traveled to Washington to push Trump to take a harder line in the Iran nuclear talks, particularly on including the Islamic Republic's arsenal of ballistic missiles.

But the Israeli and U.S. leaders apparently remained at odds, with Trump saying after their meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he had insisted the negotiations should continue.

Netanyahu said in Washington on Thursday before departing for Israel that Trump believed he was laying the ground for a deal.

"He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn't reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal," Netanyahu said, according to a video statement from his office.

But the Israeli premier added: "I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran."

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

"It's not just the nuclear issue," he said.

Despite their differences on Iran, Trump signaled his strong personal support for Netanyahu as he criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog for rejecting his request to pardon the prime minister on corruption charges.

"You have a president that refuses to give him a pardon. I think that man should be ashamed of himself," Trump said on Thursday.

Trump has repeatedly hinted at potential U.S. military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests last month, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman.

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel's war with Iran and the U.S. strikes.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear program. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to "excessive demands" on the subject.

Cry wolf all you like Trump.....you got military advice last round of threats NOT to go ahead and stage a full scale attack

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Exactly.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu. Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu.

Oh, I disagree

Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Yeah, sure. lol

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

So Trump is sending the fleet to bomb Iran....after saying this during his campaign...

"During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump’s comments on Middle East conflicts focused on ending wars and emphasizing his "America First" non-interventionist stance.

Ending "Endless Wars": Trump campaigned on the promise to "turn the page forever on those foolish, stupid days of never-ending wars," often contrasting himself with "warmongers" like Nikki Haley.

Peace Through Strength: He maintained that his legacy would be that of a "peacemaker," claiming he was the only president in generations who did not start a new war.

And one more campaign promise betrayed...

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

I think the guy is a genius, no capitulation, no apologies and keeping Iran on their toes and on high notice.

The convicted felon and Intimidator-in-Chief has spoken.

War mongering and peace making are quite the contrary.

When Biden did this he was a ‘fake tough guy war monger’.

What changed?

Bass....well Trump is a genius in not paying taxes.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if he can't bury the Epstein files.

FIFY


A reminder that Iran signed a nuclear agreement in 2015 with six countries, including the United States, Russia and China. The purpose of the agreement was to ease economic sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear development program. However, in 2018, during his first term in office, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement.

Iran insists that its nuclear development program is designed for peaceful purposes — securing nuclear fuel for nuclear power generation — and that it will continue uranium enrichment.

To put into contest the hypocrisy of the US administration, let’s not forget that Mossadegh, Iran's prime minister, was overthrown in a 1953 CIA-backed coup known as Operation Ajax. His government had nationalized Iran's oil industry, angering both the British and the U.S. After his removal, the Shah was restored to power, marking the beginning of an authoritarian regime until the 1979 Revolution.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

What does it have to do with anything, you always go on some weird  tangent, it has nothing to do with Biden capitulating to Iran and Trump doing what he said he is going to do, liberals can talk about convicted felon all this other nonsense, but what is clear and what only matters is that he's putting these mullets unnoticed and that is a good thing for the United States and for the world, especially the region

Still the typical so-called tough guy, but no one is scared except his supporters.

But but billionaire Trump didn’t pay taxes?

umm…what? Iran? Huh?

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

at least he’s back to billionaire again in the new narratives.

Handing over the own Afhanistan trauma to Iran or suffer another own Big Armada trauma, that is a fifty-fifty outcome. Better toss a coin, that's less bloody.

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

Not since he started moonlighting selling crypto instead of working for his actual bosses.

Try telling your boss you can “walk and chew gum” when he finds you’re not doing your job, see how that goes.

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

BlacklabelToday  12:43 pm JST

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

Has he got some trash racist memes ready to go on Truth Social?

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

Don't need to have troops on the ground to help destabilize the nation.

Yep he does. But really just satire. A funny joke or two.

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

Not so different from your favorite previous WH occupants then.

As much hate as your team has thrown at Biden, that's some admission - "he's the same as Joe"...and thanks for admitting he's a corrupt grifter...

Remember when Trump and MAGA-world condemned its fellow Repub NEOCONs as "warmongers who start endless conflicts in the Middle East"....and that he was going to "end all wars"?

Yea, that was THEN....now it's "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran"...."Send in the Marines"...."Get tough"....

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES....

Surprised?  Shouldn't be...

"I'll protect the unborn"....flat out lie....he's OK with 15 week abortions...

"I'll defend the 2nd Amendment"....clear lie - he's now for gun control....

"I'll release the Epstein file"...we know what a "huuuge" lie that turned out be....

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...and a lot of them are outraged...at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES

oh are we at war with anyone right now?

if so, who and where?

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...

No, he really didn't not to the point where its enraging anyone

and a lot of them are outraged...

Some, but that just goes with the territory

at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

All politicians lie, but most of policy executions done extraordinarily well.

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel’s war with Iran and the US strikes.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear programme. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to “excessive demands” on the subject. AFP

A central part of the meeting will be US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a multi-billion-dollar fund for Gaza.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 02:35 AM


WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump will announce a multi-billion dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a UN-authorised stabilisation force for the Palestinian enclave at the first formal meeting of his Board of Peace next week, two senior US officials said on Feb 12.

Delegations from at least 20 countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting in Washington DC, which Mr Trump will chair on Feb 19, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The details on Mr Trump’s plans for the first meeting of his

Board of Peace for Gaza

Mr Trump signed documents in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 23

establishing the Board of Peace

The board’s creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Mr Trump’s Gaza plan.

While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Feb 11 during his visit to Washington that Israel has joined the board.

Mr Trump has stirred concerns that the Board of Peace might try to resolve other conflicts around the world and compete with the United Nations.

The US officials said the meeting next week will focus solely on Gaza.

They said a central part of the meeting will be Mr Trump’s announcement of a multi-billion-dollar fund for Gaza, which will include monetary contributions from participating board members.

One official called the offers “generous” and said that the United States had not made any explicit requests for donations.

“People have come to us offering,” the official said. “The president will make announcements vis a vis the money raised.”

Deployment of the International Stabilisation Force is a key part of the next phase of Mr Trump’s Gaza plan, announced in September.

Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire has took place in

the two-year-old war which began on Oct 10

Mr Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead, the officials said.

A primary concern for now is disarming Hamas fighters who have been reluctant to give up their weapons.

Under Mr Trump’s Gaza plan, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty.

Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries, under the plan.

The Board of Peace meetings will also include detailed reports on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which was established to take over the day-to-day civil administration of Gaza Strip from Hamas.

The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.

Other updates will cover humanitarian aid for Gaza as well as the Gaza police, the officials said. REUTERS

TIME: Thursday evening

Text: US President Donald Trump addressed reporters Thursday evening regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, commenting on a range of political and security issues.

Trump criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog, saying, “President Herzog should be ashamed for not granting Netanyahu a pardon. He has the power to pardon and didn’t use it. The people of Israel should shame him."

On Iran, Trump warned that Tehran “must make a deal, or it will be traumatic for them. I don’t want that to happen. They should have made a deal, and they didn’t. If they don’t reach an agreement, it will be a different story."

Speaking about his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump said, “I had a good meeting with the prime minister, and he understands, but it depends on me. If the deal is fair, it will be tough for them. It needs to be quick-within a month, I think."

When asked whether Netanyahu had requested that he stop communicating with Iran, Trump replied, “He didn’t ask me to stop. I’ll speak with them as much as I want. But if we don’t reach phase two, it will be tough for them. I don’t expect that to happen."

Addressing Netanyahu’s responsibility for the October 7 attacks, Trump said, “Everyone is responsible. It was a terrible attack. He didn’t see it coming, and no one else would have in his place. He was a great prime minister for a time of war."

The Israeli president’s office responded: “For clarity, as repeatedly emphasized, the prime minister’s request is under review according to Ministry of Justice procedures. Only after this process is complete will the president examine the request based on the law, the best interest of the state, and his conscience, without any influence from external or internal pressures."

It added, “President Herzog appreciates President Trump’s significant contribution to Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state governed by law. Contrary to the impression created by President Trump’s remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on this matter."

Text: A Jewish student from Yeshiva University was attacked on Thursday night at a train station near the university’s campus in Washington Heights, Manhattan.

Members of the local Jewish community reported that the student was assaulted by six to eight masked assailants at around 7:00 p.m. local time. They added that the assault took place at a blind spot with no cameras or police.

A Jewish student from Yeshiva University was attacked on Thursday night at a train station near the university’s campus in Washington Heights, Manhattan.

Members of the local Jewish community reported that the student was assaulted by six to eight masked assailants at around 7:00 p.m. local time. They added that the assault took place at a blind spot with no cameras or police.

Commenting on the incident, a Yeshiva University spokesperson said, "This evening at approximately 7:00 p.m., one of our students was assaulted in an unbiased attempted robbery off campus in the subway station at 181st Street. He is back on campus in good condition."

“YU Security is aware of the incident and is coordinating with law enforcement authorities," added the spokesperson.

Although the incident appears to be unrelated to antisemitism, it comes amid a sharp spike in antisemitism in New York. According to newly released data by the NYPD, antisemitic hate crimes in New York City rose 182% year over year in January 2026.


On Holocaust Remembrance Day at the end of January, a Queens rabbi was assaulted in the Forest Hills neighborhood in a suspected antisemitic attack.

A day later, a man was filmed repeatedly driving a car into the doors of a synagogue at the Chabad-Lubavitch headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

The year-on-year rise in antisemitic hate crimes coincides with the first month of the administration of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, whose election sparked concerns of growing antisemitism in the city with the largest Jewish population in America.

On his first day in office, Mamdani issued an executive order revoking all orders signed by his predecessor, Eric Adams, after September 26, 2024. This meant that the city’s recognition of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) was revoked, as well as an Adams order prohibiting mayoral appointees and agency staff from boycotting and disinvesting from Israel.

Text: The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) has confirmed that the Ireland Men's National Team will fulfill its 2026 UEFA Nations League fixtures against Israel, Reuters reported Thursday.

The announcement came after the teams were drawn to face each other in Group B3, alongside Austria and Kosovo, with matches scheduled between September and November. This announcement comes three months after Ireland's call for Israel's expulsion from European soccer competitions.

In a statement released immediately after the draw, the FAI affirmed its commitment to playing Israel, noting that refusal to participate in a scheduled match would lead to forfeiture and potential disciplinary actions, including disqualification from the competition.

Ireland’s previous request for Israel’s exclusion from UEFA competitions, made in November, cited alleged violations of UEFA statutes. The FAI accused the Israeli soccer association of not enforcing an effective anti-racism policy and allowing Israeli clubs to play in Palestinian Authority-assigned territories without the PA soccer association's consent. The request was overwhelmingly backed by FAI members at the time.

The FAI has stated that consultations have taken place with UEFA officials since the request, although no further details were provided. The governing body made it clear that the regulations required them to honor their Nations League commitments despite the ongoing concerns.

Ties between Israel and Ireland have been especially strained in recent years, as the Irish government has been one of the most vocal critics of Israel. In April of 2024, then-Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris failed to mention the hostages being held by Hamas during his first speech after being elected leader, resulting in criticism from Israel’s Foreign Ministry.




More recently, Ireland elected far-left President Catherine Connolly who has labeled Israel a “terrorist state."

The Metropolitan Police said it has cost around £6million to police protests associated with the group

The Home Office has spent nearly £700,000 of taxpayer money fighting a legal challenge brought by Palestine Action.

Huda Ammori, co-founder of the proscribed group, launched legal action following the Government’s decision to designate the organisation as a terror group.

Since the ban came into force, thousands of people have been arrested for holding signs expressing support for Palestine Action.

Figures disclosed through a Freedom of Information request, seen by The Independent, show the Home Office has incurred legal costs of £694,390.03.

The funds were used to cover Government Legal Department costs, counsel fees and other court expenses linked to the case.

Lawyers for Palestine Action argued in High Court that the decision by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was "novel and unprecedented".

Defending the group, Raza Hussain KC said the group was a "direct action civil disobedience organisation that does not advocate for violence".

He added that cases of serious violence by the group were a rarity.

Lawyers for Palestine Action argued that the decision by Yvette Cooper was 'novel and unprecedented'

A spokesman for Defend Our Juries, who have campaigned to lift the ban on Palestine Action, said: "None of the costs arising from this crackdown are in the public interest.

"These are unnecessary and politically-driven costs that serve only to protect companies which the UN has named as profiting from genocide and the state of Israel itself."

The group was proscribed after an incident where activists broke into an RAF base in Oxfordshire and sprayed military planes with red paint.

Mrs Cooper cited an incident in Bristol at Elbit Systems UK, an Israeli defence firm, as one of the reasons to proscribe Palestine Action.

Metropolitan Police told the London Assembly that it had cost around £6million to police protests

GETTY

However, six activists linked to the group were cleared of aggravated burglary following a break-in trial at Woolwich Crown Court in south London last week.

All six were acquitted of aggravated burglary, while the jury - after deliberating for 36 hours and 34 minutes - failed to reach verdicts on separate criminal damage charges.

The legal costs pale in comparison to the wider expense of policing demonstrations in support of Palestine Action since the group was proscribed.

Metropolitan Police told the London Assembly that it had cost around £.6million to police protests and carry out arrests associated with the proscription of Palestine Action.

Government data spanning to September 2025 revealed there were 1,630 arrests linked to supporting Palestine Action.

Nearly 500 were arrested at a protest in support of Palestine Action organised by Defend Our Juries in October.

Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, told The Telegraph: "The staggering costs of this court case emphasise how committed the UK government is to stifling legitimate criticism of Israel.

"The use of counter-terrorism legislation to proscribe Palestine Action is a grave abuse of state power and just one of a suite of measures this government is using to curtail people’s right to protest."

Text: The speaker of the Bundestag, Julia Klöckner, entered as far as the so-called "Yellow Line" of predominantly Israeli control in Gaza. She held no talks with Palestinians, prompting some criticism at home.

Julia Klöckner on Thursday became the first German politician to set foot in the Gaza Strip since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and Israel's subsequent military operations against the territory.

According to the Bundestag,Germany's lower house of parliament, Klöckner spent around an hour in Gaza within the area controlled by Israel's military on Thursday, as part of her three-day trip.

Accompanying journalists were not permitted to join the Bundestag speaker on her brief embed with the Israel Defense Forces into Gaza.

The 53-year-old member of the governing Christian Democrats welcomed Israel's decision to allow a German parliamentary observer access to the Gaza Strip, according to the Bundestag.

She called on Israel's government to continue to pursue the path of opening up the territory following the ceasefire deal struck late last year. While the ceasefire has prevented the outbreak of large-scale fighting, the Israeli military has launched attacks in recent weeks over what it says were violations of the truce.


She said the so-called Yellow Line included in that ceasefire accord that denotes the area controlled by Israel's military was not envisaged as a border but rather a temporary demarcation line.

"It cannot become a lasting barrier," Klöckner said.

She also appealed for the access of international and independent observers, saying that a "transparent picture of the situation strengthens trust."

During her visit, Klöckner also addressed Israel's parliament, the Knesset, laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, spoke with Israeli soldiers and with relatives of those killed during the attack at the Nova Music Festival on October 7, 2023, near the border to Gaza.

It was not clear until the last moment whether Klöckner's brief excursion into Gaza would go ahead. Despite the ceasefire struck last year, lower-level fighting is still fairly common in the region.

Israel's parliament, which had invited Klöckner, was said to have played a meaningful role in arranging the authorization.

The German Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it does not comment on visits or potential security concerns related to political trips organized by separate German political institutions.

Although she's a senior member of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats, Klöckner is not a member of his Cabinet.

German government ministers, including current Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul have visited the West Bank, including for talks with Palestinians, since the October 7 attacks and the ensuing war in Gaza, but they had not entered the Gaza Strip.

The leader of the opposition Greens, Franziska Brantner, criticized Klöckner's trip as unsatisfactory in an interview with Der Spiegel. She said Klöckner would only be sampling a limited glimpse of the reality in the Gaza Strip.

"It is good that Bundestag speaker Julia Klöckner would like to get a picture of what's happening on the ground in Gaza," Brantner said. "But if she does this without even listening to the Palestinian side, she must be willing to accept the allegation that she's only really interested in a one-sided view of the reality in the region."

Text: NEW YORK, February 12. /TASS/. The United States has secretly delivered several thousand Starlink terminals to protesters in Iran, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

According to the report, almost 6,000 terminals were illegally sent through the Iranian border. Over the past few months, the US Department of State has purchased approximately 7,000 Starlink terminals, most of them in January.

US President Donald Trump was informed of the move, but it is unclear whether he directly authorized it.

In January, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk's SpaceX had cancelled the fee needed to access Starlink infrastructure in Iran.

Unrest in Iran began on December 29 after street protests triggered by a sharp fall in the Iranian rial exchange rate, and spread to most major cities. Authorities reported the deaths of 40 law enforcement officers. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, armed terrorists appeared among the demonstrators on January 8. Iranian authorities blamed Israel and the United States for organizing the unrest. On January 23, Araghchi said that the death toll from the riots had reached 3,117, with both civilians and security officers among the victims. Washington warned that it was considering the use of force against the Islamic Republic.

Egypt’s participation comes after Israel recognised the breakaway region of Somaliland and at a time when regional attention is focused on the Red Sea and the ongoing conflict in Sudan.

The troops conducted field exercises and showcased military vehicles and equipment that will be involved in the mission.

Somali President Hassan Sheik Mohamud and the Egyptian minister of defence inspected the troops and their level of readiness and combat preparedness.

The deployment marks a significant step in the growing security partnerships between the two countries.

Text: Stifan Salama, the Palestinian Authority (PA) official in charge of finance and planning, warned in a press conference held in Ramallah that the financial situation of the PA has become "extremely dangerous" due to Israel's refusal to transfer PA tax revenues for the tenth consecutive month. Salama claimed that this delay threatens the continuation of basic services for citizens.

Salama noted that Israel is holding an amount equal to approximately 13 billion shekels  of PA tax revenues. He said, "What we are experiencing is not a temporary crisis but an existential threat to public finances, the economy, and the entire Palestinian national project. This is being driven by the Israeli government, which has decided to destroy the Palestinian Authority. What they are doing to the Palestinian banks is playing with fire and crossing all red lines."

He further stated that had Israel transferred the tax revenues as per the agreements signed with it, the PA would have been able to pay full salaries to civil servants and end the year with a deficit of less than 400 million shekels. However, due to Israeli policy, Salama claimed, the Authority finished the year with an actual deficit exceeding 4.5 billion shekels.

According to the law, Israel deducts around 50 million shekels from the taxes transferred to the PA, an amount equivalent to the salaries paid by the PA to prisoners and terrorists. These withheld funds are redirected to victims of terrorism as part of the economic warfare against terrorism, aimed at reducing incentives for carrying out attacks.

Text: 					Japan
			©2026

German director Wim Wenders said on Thursday filmmakers must stay out of politics and focus on changing how people think, at the ‌start of the Berlin Film Festival.

Considered more politically minded than its counterparts in Venice and Cannes, the festival has been repeatedly criticized by pro-Palestinian activists for not taking an overt stance on Gaza, in contrast ‌to the war in Ukraine and the situation in Iran.

Asked for ⁠his view on the German government's position on Gaza, Wenders said: "We ⁠have to stay out ⁠of politics because if we made movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the ‌field of politics, but we are the counterweight to politics."

Germany's response to the Gaza war has ⁠been criticized as overly cautious, mostly owing ⁠to an enduring sense of guilt for the Nazi Holocaust.

Speaking to journalists at the festival, where he is head of this year's seven-member international jury, the 80-year-old said: "We have to do the work of people and not the work of ⁠politicians."

The livestream of the press conference cut out shortly after the question on Gaza, ⁠prompting the journalist who asked it to ‌accuse the festival of censorship.

Organizers issued an apology for what they said were technical problems and said they would make the full recording available online.

Wenders, whose film career spans from "Wings of Desire" four decades ago to 2023's "Perfect Days", said ‌being on the jury in Berlin was a unique experience.

"Because in Berlin, you can be sure you see more facets of the world than in any other festival. And that's the great strength of the Berlinale," said Wenders.

Organizers have repeatedly faced questions on Gaza and calls for a boycott by pro-Palestinian groups. In turn, the closing ceremony in 2024 drew criticism from German politicians after several winners expressed solidarity with the Palestinians and criticized Israel's ​actions after the October 7, 2023 attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

"Movies can change the world. Not in a political way. No movie has really changed ‌any politician's idea. But we can change .. the idea that people have of how they should live," the veteran director said.

The festival begins on Thursday evening with the opening film "No Good Men" and culminates with the ‌closing ceremony on February 21, when Wenders and his jury will award the Golden ⁠Bear top prize to one of ⁠a total of 22 films in competition.

Four ​members of this year's jury are from Asia: Min Bahadur Bham, who directed ⁠the festival's first Nepalese competition ‌film, "Shambhala"; South Korean actor Bae Doona; Indian director, producer and archivist ​Shivendra Singh Dungarpur; and Hikari, who recently directed Japan-set drama "Rental Family."

U.S. director Reinaldo Marcus Green, whose biographical sports drama "King Richard" earned six Oscar nominations, and renowned Polish producer Ewa Puszczynska, round out the jury.





Wenders is the type of artist we saw in the Weimar Republic who watched, arms folded, the resistible rise of the Austrian corporal from his ivory tower:

"Movies can change the world. Not in a political way. No movie has really changed ‌any politician's idea. But we can change .. the idea that people have of how they should live,"

Hmm. OK, this is the usual cop-out of a careerist filmmaker who knows on which side his "Brot" is buttered in a business where pro-Palestinian views can silence your phone.

Germany's response to the Gaza war has ⁠been criticized as overly cautious, mostly owing ⁠to an enduring sense of guilt for the Nazi Holocaust.

Hmm, it's not "Germany", not the majority of Germans, but the tiny group of people who call themselves the "government" who are actively supporting with weapons and political and diplomatic cover the mass-killing of civilians in the Gaza "Ghetto" and the West Bank, which makes them yet again guilty of their third G. in just over a hundred years. And anyone, including Jews, who, unlike Wenders, dares to protest in public will be pummelled and arrested by a militarized police no less brutal in their MO than the braunshirts were.

Text: TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (MNA) – The African Union's (AU) Peace and Security Council on Thursday reaffirmed Somalia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any recognition of Somaliland as an independent state.

The council issued a statement in which it "reiterates its strong condemnation and rejection of Israel's unilateral recognition of the so-called Republic of Somaliland" and demanded its immediate revocation, Anadolu Agency reported.

At the ministerial-level meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, the council stated that "no actor has the authority or standing to alter the territorial configuration of an African Union Member State," and that any such declaration is null and void and has no legal effect under international law.

The strong-worded statement by the Peace and Security Council comes in response to Israel's announcement on Dec, 26 of last year that it had officially recognized Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, becoming the sole country to do so. The move drew sharp criticism from across the region.

The council welcomed recent military gains against the al-Shabaab terrorist group and encouraged Somali security forces, supported by the AU mission (AUSSOM) and partners, to sustain operations to “more effectively degrade and ultimately defeat Al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups.”

Text: TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (MNA) – Leader of Yemen's Ansarullah Resistance Movement Abdul-Malik al-Houthi says that Iranian and Yemeni revolutions inspire Islamic nation to fight off enemy’s conspiracies.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Houthi said the historic resistance of the two countries carries important lessons for the Muslim world, reinforcing hope and confidence in divine promises.

He added that the shared experience has been reinforced as adversaries of Islam and humanity are pushing forward their schemes -- among them the so-called “New Middle East” and “Greater Israel” -- using their proxies and allies.

He also extended his congratulations to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and the Iranian people on the anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

He emphasized that the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran led to the establishment of an independent Muslim country free from US hegemony, according to Press TV.

The Yemeni leader praised Iran’s steadfastness against the Israeli regime’s conspiracies for 47 years, while supporting oppressed nations, foremost among them the Palestinian people.

Text: Rep. Elise Stefanik is urging US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to launch a probe of Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s Department of Health, after staffers allegedly used taxpayers’ resources to launch a “global oppression” working group that accused Israel of genocide.

Stefanik (R-NY), chairwoman of House Republican Leadership, specifically asked whether the health agency workers violated civil rights law barring discrimination by federally funded agencies.

“The use of federal funds to support or tolerate government-sponsored activities that veer into ideological advocacy or that risk emboldening hate is a grave matter with civil rights and public safety implications,” Stefanik said in a Feb. 10 letter to Kennedy.

“Jewish Americans and all faith communities deserve protection against discrimination, including from actions carried out in the name of public health.”

Stefanik, who considered but declined to run for governor this year, noted that antisemitic hate crimes skyrocketed 182% in the Big Apple in January compared to a year ago, just one month into Israel critic Mamdani’s mayoralty.

She requested that Kennedy and the HHS inspector general take the following actions:

House Speaker Mike Johnson also slammed the politicization of the city’s health agency.


The Post exclusively revealed last week that DOH staffers had created the “Global Oppression and Public Health Working Group,” which held its first meeting during the middle of the workday from the agency’s HQ in Long Island City.

“We really developed in response to the ongoing genocide in Palestine,” one presenter reading from the group’s mission statement said near the beginning of the meeting, according to the video obtained by The Post.

Mamdani and the health department have repeatedly declined to comment on the controversy — which also sparked blowback from City Council Speaker Julie Menin (D-Manhattan).

Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse declined to comment when a Post reporter confronted her following a press conference Wednesday on overdose prevention.

Morse, also the department’s chief medical officer, referred The Post to her spokesperson.

City Hall and the health department had no immediate comment Thursday on Stefanik calling for a federal probe of the agency.

Text: Iran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.

This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.

The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.

Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.

Trump said the strikes had "obliterated" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials "were thinking about starting a new site".

Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.

A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.

A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.

At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.

Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.

ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.

"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment," they said.

Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.

At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal.

Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would "help dampen" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside.

Also at Isfahan nuclear site, a new roof has been constructed. The building, attacked in an Israeli strike last year, is thought have been used in the manufacture of centrifuges.

Above-ground work is also visible at Natanz nuclear facility at a location damaged in air strikes by both Israel and the US last June. Between early December and January a roof has been built over a damaged anti-drone cage at an enrichment plant.

ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.

Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is "operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can".

"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed," he added. "Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything."

Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.

"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment," he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.

He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.

A potential restructure would affect sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield, a union says.

The expiration of New START means there are no limits on nuclear weapons between both countries for the first time since 1991.

Channels of communication were suspended in 2021 shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.


Tehran says its armed forces are ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression.

A report by the U.N. Security Council sanctions monitoring team has noted that Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed was reported to be linked to a terror attack on the Red Fort in New Delhi last November that killed 15 people.

“One Member State noted that Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for a series of attacks. It was also reported to be linked to an attack on the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 9 that killed 15 people,” the 37th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted to the Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee concerning ISIL and al-Qaeda said.

The report, issued in United Nations, added that on October 8, JeM leader Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi “formally announced the establishment of a women-only wing, Jamaat ul-Muminat, which was aimed at supporting terrorist attacks.”

Even as another member state reported that Jaish-e-Mohammed was defunct, the report added that “Separately, it was reported that on July 28, three individuals allegedly involved in the attack perpetrated in Pahalgam, in Jammu and Kashmir, were killed.”

A deadly and high-intensity explosion had rocked the Red Fort area in New Delhi, killing about 15 people and injuring many more. The explosion had ripped through a slow-moving car at a traffic signal near the Red Fort metro station.

At his weekly briefing in New Delhi on Thursday (February 12), Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was asked for a comment on the UNSC report.

"This particular report that you refer to, it is available in the public domain. It is online. This was the 37th Report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. This was published on February 4, 2026," he said.

"And, we have seen that they have taken on board our inputs, India's inputs in regard to our concern on cross-border terrorism, and also as to how we can strengthen the global fight against terrorism," the MEA spokesperson said.

The UNSC report further said that Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) remained active in south-eastern Afghanistan, where the Haqqani Network exerts considerable influence. Osama Mahmoud, the “emir” of AQIS, and Yahya Ghauri, his deputy, were reported to be in Kabul, with the media cell of AQIS based in Herat.

“There were concerns that AQIS was increasingly focused on external operations. Such operations would likely be unclaimed or deniable operations, perhaps as part of the umbrella group Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan…so as not to create difficulties for the Taliban as hosts of AQIS,” it said.

The report added that ISIL-K was active mainly in northern Afghanistan, particularly Badakhshan, and areas close to the Pakistani border. It continued to develop its network of cells to project a threat regionally and beyond.

“Aggressive propaganda by ISIL-K in Central Asian languages expanded its target audience. It sought to exploit issues such as the Gaza and Israel conflict to promote recruitment and financing,” it added.

Text: The world’s largest aircraft carrier has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East, a person familiar with the plans said Thursday, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran.

The move by the USS Gerald R. Ford, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three guided-missile destroyers arrived in the Middle East more than two weeks ago.

It marks a quick turnaround for the USS Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration build up a huge military presence in the leadup to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

It also appears to be at odds with Trump’s national security strategy, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.

Trump on Thursday warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman last week.

“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear program. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”

Trump told Axios earlier this week that he was considering sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East.

Trump held lengthy talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue.

Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.

The USS Ford set out on deployment in late June 2025, which means the crew will have been deployed for eight months in two weeks time.

While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an usually long deployment.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

UNITED NATIONS: Iran’s election as vice-chair of the United Nations Commission for Social Development is being slammed by human rights advocates and policy analysts, who have condemned the U.N.'s hypocrisy when it comes to its treatment of undemocratic regimes.

The leadership role was approved without objection during a meeting of the commission, where delegates adopted agenda items and organizational decisions by consensus.

The United Nations has faced continued criticism over its inaction towards the regime's violent crackdown against protesters in December and January. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres faced criticism for congratulating Iran on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

UN CHIEF BLASTED AS ‘ABJECTLY TONE-DEAF’ OVER MESSAGE TO IRAN MARKING REVOLUTION ANNIVERSARY


U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz criticized the development, writing on X: "Yet another reason why we are not a member of, nor do we participate in, this ridiculous ‘Commission for Social Development.’"

Alireza Jafarzadeh, author of The Iran Threat and deputy director of the U.S. office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, also criticized the decision. "Having the Iranian regime in the leadership of a U.N. body tasked with promoting democracy, gender equality, tolerance and non-violence is appalling and like fox guarding the hen house," Jafarzadeh said. "The vast majority of the Iranian people are calling for regime change because the mullahs are the world’s leading human rights violators, misogynist to the core, and they slaughter the voices of dissent by thousands."

He argued that Iran should face scrutiny rather than institutional advancement. "Instead, the Iranian regime must be a subject of intense investigation and accountability by all U.N. bodies for crimes against humanity and genocide, from the 1980s to January 2026 uprisings," Jafarzadeh said. "Decades of inaction by Western governments have emboldened the regime. This must stop now."

"By electing Iran to help lead a commission devoted to democracy, women’s rights and non-violence, the U.N. makes itself into a mockery," said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. "This is a regime that brutalizes women for not covering their hair, and that just massacred tens of thousands of its own civilians in two days."

Neuer argued that governments had the ability to block the appointment but chose not to act. "The EU states know how to stop abusive regimes from winning these seats — they’ve done so in the recent past with Russia — but this time on Iran, they chose silence and complicity," he said. "By rewarding the Mullahs right after their slaughter of innocents, the U.N. has now sent a very dangerous message to Tehran."

Lisa Daftari, an Iran analyst, said the optics of Iran holding a leadership role in a commission centered on social development and rights were deeply troubling.



"For Iranian women who risk prison or worse just for taking off a headscarf, watching Tehran get a vice-chair on a U.N. social-development commission feels like a slap in the face."

She added that broader patterns in U.N. voting and resolutions contribute to perceptions of bias.

"When the same U.N. system has spent the last decade passing roughly 170-plus resolutions against Israel and only around 80 on all other countries combined, you don’t need a PhD to see there’s a bias problem," Daftari said. "When the U.N. has churned out well over a hundred anti-Israel resolutions in recent years while managing a fraction of that number on the world’s worst dictatorships, it looks less like moral leadership and more like political theater."


Protesters burn images of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally held in Solidarity with Iran's Uprising, organized by The national Council of Resistance of Iran, on Whitehall in central London Jan. 11, 2026, to protest against the Iranian regime's crackdown on internet access and "recognise their right to self-defense against the regime's forces".  (Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)

Daftari rejected that procedural nature of United Nations committees and committees.

"Some diplomats will wave this away as a procedural formality, but at the U.N. nothing is ever purely symbolic," she said. "The bottom line is that handing Iran’s regime a gavel on ‘social development’ confirms yet again that the place is biased and deeply hypocritical."

Text: Germany's Federal Constitutional Court on Thursday dismissed a case brought by a Palestinian Arab from Gaza who sought to sue the German government over its weapons exports to Israel, AFP reported.

The complainant, supported by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), aimed to challenge German export licenses for parts used in Israeli tanks deployed in Gaza.

The case had already been rejected by lower courts in 2024 and 2025, prompting an appeal to Germany’s highest court in Karlsruhe. The court ruled that the complainant had not sufficiently demonstrated that the lower courts had misjudged the case or arbitrarily denied any potential obligation to protect him.

While acknowledging Germany's obligation to protect human rights and respect international humanitarian law, the court emphasized that this does not imply the state must take specific action on behalf of individuals. The court also stressed that it is the responsibility of state authorities to decide how to fulfill their general duty of protection.

In response to the ruling, the ECCHR expressed disappointment, calling the decision “a setback for civilian access to justice."

The case was part of a broader effort by five Palestinian Arabs who initiated a lawsuit against the German government in 2024. The ECCHR had been hoping for a favorable outcome after the court ruled last year that Germany has a general duty to protect fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law, even in cases involving foreign countries.

In August of last year, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Berlin would not approve the transfer of military equipment to Israel, including weapons which could be used in the war in Gaza.

In a statement announcing the move, Merz said he is "very concerned about the suffering of the population in the Strip." He also demanded that Israel "not take any steps toward annexation" of Judea and Samaria.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Merz after his announcement of the arms embargo and expressed his disappointment with the decision.


In November, the German government announced that Germany would lift the freeze on weapons shipments to Israel and transfers will resume as normal.

Text: The Shabbat which either coincides with or immediately precedes Rosh Chodesh Adar (or Adar 2 in a leap year) is Shabbat Shekalim (Mishnah, Megillah 3:4; Rambam, Laws of Prayer and Priestly Blessing 13:20; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 685:1 and 5).

“Parashat Shekalim is in memory of the mitzvah of the half-shekel…which they were obligated to give to the Temple treasury for the continual offering each year" (Mishnah Berurah, 685:1).

The Rambam, following Mishnah Shekalim 1:1- details how and when the half-shekel donation to the Temple treasury was given:

“On the first of Adar the announcements concerning the shekels were made... On the fifteenth, the treasurers would sit in each city, and demand [the half-shekel due] gently…and those who did not give, they did not force them to give. On the twenty-fifth they would sit in the Temple to collect it; and from then on, they would force those who had not yet given to pay up" (Laws of Shekalim 1:9).

These half-shekel taxes were then used from the 1st of Nisan a few days later until the final day of Adar a year later for the Tamid (twice-daily sacrifice) and for the Musaf Offerings (the additional sacrifices on Rosh Chodesh, Pesach, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot) of that year (Tiferet Yisrael commentary to Mishnah Shekalim 1:1).

So in memory of the half-shekel donation that once was, and looking forward to the half-shekel donation that will one day be again, we read this parasha in the same week that the Sanhedrin would impose (and will one day again impose) this tax.

Much has been written about the half-shekel, and I offer here just two out of countless observations:

A very obvious question is:

Why did G-d command every Jew to donate half-a-shekel? Why not a whole shekel?

- In order to show that no Jew is whole in and of himself. Only by conjoining with other Jews, by being part of the community, can he be whole.

And second:

Why does the Torah use the unexpected phrase מַחֲצִית הַשֶּׁקֶל for “half-a-shekel"? Why not the expected phrase חֲצִי שֶׁקֶל?

The words מַחֲצִית and חֲצִי both mean “half", but מַחֲצִית is more active, so to speak. It is impossible to convey precisely in English, but חֲצִי suggests half of something, while מַחֲצִית suggests something that has been deliberately halved.

Rabbi Yosef Patzanovski, in his Torah-commentary Pardes Yosef (Exodus 30:13), notes that the centre of מַחֲצִית is the letter צ, denoting the Tzaddik, the righteous man. The two letters adjacent to the צ are ח and י, denoting חַי, “live"; the two letters distant from the צ are מ and ת, denoting מֵת, “dead".

One who is far from the Tzaddik, isolated from the Tzaddik, is dead. One who is close to the Tzaddik, unified with the Tzaddik, is truly alive.

Shabbat Shekalim is the first of five special Shabbatot.

The second is Shabbat Zachor (the Shabbat of Remembrance), commemorating Amalek’s attack on us. This is the Shabbat immediately before Purim (this year on 11th Adar/28th February).

The third is Shabbat Parah, recalling the Red Cow which cleansed from the impurity of death (Numbers 19). This is the Parashah which prepares us to cleanse ourselves spiritually in preparation for Pesach, and is either the final Shabbat or the penultimate Shabbat in Adar (this year on 18th Adar/7th March).

The fourth is Shabbat Ha-Chodesh (The Month), the Shabbat which either coincides with or immediately precedes the 1st of Nissan, which is the basis of the Jewish calendar (this year on 25th Adar/14th March).

And the fifth and last is Shabbat Ha-Gadol (the Great Sabbath), the Shabbat immediately preceding Pesach (this year on 10th Nissan/28th March).

These five special Shabbatot, spanning 7 weeks, are like links in a chain. The first, this Shabbat, is invariably the final Shabbat in Sh’vat, is the harbinger of Adar, and by extension the harbinger of Purim.

The last is the harbinger of Pesach.

This chain, linking Purim to Pesach, begins this Shabbat, and will conclude 47 days later as we sit at the Seder Table to celebrate Pesach.

The Seder Service concludes with חַד גַּדְיָא, Chad Gadya - the one kind which father bought for two zuzim.

This one little kid is Israel, G-d’s first-born son (Exodus 4:22) whom G-d “bought" for two zuzim.

The zuz was a unit of currency (also called a dinar), a silver coin, equal to 192 p’rutot (the smallest unit of currency, a copper coin), and four zuzim made one shekel.

So when our Father G-d “bought" us for two zuzim, He “bought" us for מַחֲצִית הַשֶּׁקֶל - the half-a-shekel that we recall this Shabbat.

As every Jew acquires his share in the Holy Temple for half-a-shekel, so G-d “acquires" His share in Israel for the same half-a-shekel.

The Haftarah for Shabbat Shekalim relates a time of the restoration of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.  Excerpted from 2 Kings 11:17-12:17, it begins with the aftermath of the revolution which the Judeans had conducted against their evil and idolatrous Queen Ataliya.

As Rabbi Dr Joseph Hertz (Chief Rabbi of the British Empire 1913-1946) notes, the Kingdom of Judea existed for some three-and-a-half centuries, and in all that time there was only one insurrection - and that was against a foreign usurper, Queen Ataliya, who had attempted to exterminate the native dynasty of the House of David

Ataliya’s father was Achav (Ahab), the seventh King of Israel (the northern kingdom) after it had split from Judea (the southern kingdom, which was ruled by the royal line of King David throughout its history). Her mother was the Sidonian idolatress Izevel (Jezebel), who upon marrying Achav corrupted him even further than he already was.

Ataliya had married King Yehoram of Judea, and used her power and influence to foster Ba’al-worship in Judea.

When King Yehoram died her power increased. When Yehu (Jehu) killed her son, his widow should have taken over - and so Ataliya, daughter of the evil idolatress Izevel (Jezebel) proceeded to murder her own grandchildren in order to consolidate her own position on the Judean Throne.

The only survivor was the infant Yehoash (Joash), concealed by his aunt who was married to Yehoyada (Jehoiada), the Kohen Gadol (High Priest). It was Yehoyada who led this popular uprising against idolatry and corruption, inspired the masses to smash the idolatrous temples, revealed the seven-year-old prince and true heir to the Throne of Judea, seated the boy on his Throne, and inspired the people to kill Ataliya by the sword.

The insurrection was over, the people had restored the House of David to its rightful place as kings of Judea, and King Yehoash, infant though he was, was already guiding the nation back to G-d, and restored the Holy Temple.

The מַחֲצִית הַשֶּׁקֶל, half-shekel, was restored. This is a fitting Haftarah for Shabbat Shekalim.

The Haftarah records that the King’s Scribe and Kohen Gadol paid the workers who were appointed over the work in the Holy Temple (2 Kings 12:12). And here there is a peculiarity in the text: the word “appointed" is הַמֻּפְקָדִים - but it is invariably written as הפקדים, without the  מ(mem). This is how it appears in all hand-written parchment Scrolls of the Prophets, and in almost all printed editions.

Why is the letter  מ(mem) missing here?

- I don’t know why. But I suggest that it balances out King David’s Song of Victory which he composed and sang near the end of his life, “on the day that Hashem saved him from the hand of all his enemies and the hand of Saul" (2 Samuel 22:1), a Song which, with minor changes, constitutes the Eighteenth Psalm:

“Hashem thundered from Heaven, the Supreme One gave forth His voice; He sent out His arrows and scattered them - lightning, and He terrified them" (2 Samuel 22:14-15).

The word for “He terrified them" is וַיָּהֹם - but in this verse, it appears as ויהמם, with an extra letter  מ(mem).

Are these connected? Does the missing מ (mem) in the Haftarah for Shabbat Shekalim really compensate for the extra מ (mem) King David’s Song from a century-and-a-half earlier?

- Again, I don’t know. But I do note that Hazal, our Sages, selected this Song of King David as the Haftarah for the seventh day of Pesach.

As the מַחֲצִית הַשֶּׁקֶל, half-shekel, which we recall this Shabbat culminates with the conclusion of the Seder Night, so the missing מ (mem) in the Haftarah for Shabbat Shekalim is balanced out by the extra מ (mem) in the Haftarah that concludes Pesach.

Text: Syrian government forces have taken over the al-Tanf base in eastern Syria, a site the U.S. military has run for years

DAMASCUS, Syria -- DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syrian government forces have taken control of a base in the east of the country that was run for years by U.S. troops as part of the war against the Islamic State group, the Defense Ministry said in a statement Thursday.

The al-Tanf base sits on a strategic location, close to the borders with Jordan and Iraq. In a terse statement, the Syrian Defense Ministry said the handover of the base took place in coordination with the U.S. military and Syrian forces are now “securing the base and its perimeters.”

The U.S. military did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press regarding the Syrian statement.

The Syrian Defense Ministry also said that Syrian troops are now in place in the desert area around the al-Tanf garrison, with border guards to deploy in the coming days.

The deployment of Syrian troops at al-Tanf and in the surrounding areas comes after last month’s deal between the government and the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to merge into the military.

Al-Tanf garrison was repeatedly attacked over the past years with drones by Iran-backed groups but such attacks have dropped sharply following the fall of Bashar Assad’s government in Syria in December 2024 when insurgent groups marched into his seat of power in Damascus.

Syria’s interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has been expanding his control of the country, and last month government forces captured wide parts of northeast Syria after deadly clashes with the SDF. A ceasefire was later reached between the two sides.

Al-Tanf base played a major role in the fight against the Islamic State group that declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later.

Over the past weeks, the U.S. military began transferring thousands of IS prisoners from prisons run by the SDF in northeastern Syria to Iraq, where they will be prosecuted.

The number of U.S. troops posted in Syria has changed over the years.

The number of U.S. troops increased to more than 2,000 after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas in Israel, as Iranian-backed militants targeted American troops and interests in the region in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.

The force has since been drawn back down to around 900.

Text: At the opening press conference of the Berlin International Film Festival, jury president Wim Wenders avoided taking a stance on Palestinian rights.

The Berlin International Film Festival is no stranger to political controversies, but the first one to hit this year's event happened hours before the Berlinale officially kicked off on February 12 with its opening film, "No Good Men," during a press conference introducing the international jury in the morning.

The conference brought together festival director Tricia Tuttle and the seven people who will be selecting the winners of the Golden and Silver Bears: Jury president Wim Wenders, director of acclaimed films including "Wings of Desire" and the Oscar-nominated "Perfect Days," and his fellow jurors — Nepalese director Min Bahadur; South Korean actor Bae Doona; Indian director, producer and archivist Shivendra Singh Dungarpur; US director, screenwriter and producer Reinaldo Marcus Green; Japanese director, screenwriter and producer HIKARI and Polish producer Ewa Puszczynska.

The livestream of the press conference was interrupted just as political journalist Tilo Jung asked the members of the jury how they felt about the Berlinale's and the German government's stance on Gaza.

Referring to one of the jurors' previous comments on how cinema had the power to change the world, and noting that the festival does not happen in a vacuum, Jung reminded that "the Berlinale as an institution has famously shown solidarity with people in Iran and Ukraine, but never with Palestine, even today."

He went on to ask: "In light of the German government's support of the genocide in Gaza and its role as the main funder of the Berlinale, do you as a member of the jury…"

The livestream was cut off before the host of the podcast "Jung & Naiv" could end his question: "Do you as a member of the jury support this selective treatment of human rights?"

The interruption prompted speculation as to whether the festival had attempted to censor the topic, which organizers promptly denied.

"We had technical problems with the web streaming of the press conference with the international jury this morning," the Berlinale press office said in a statement, in which they also apologized. It adding that the full recording of the press conference would be made available on the festival's website "as soon as possible."

"I find it hard to believe this was just a coincidence," Jung told DW, pointing out that Berlinale director Tricia Tuttle, who was leading the press conference, initially tried to steer away from the topic before some of the jury members offered tense reactions that avoided a direct answer to the question.

"Asking us this question is a little bit unfair," first said Ewa Puszczynska, producer of Holocaust drama "The Zone of Interest." Acknowledging that she had previously talked about how cinema "changes the world," she added, "of course, we are trying to talk to every single viewer, to make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what that decision would be — the decision to support Israel, or the decision to support Palestine."

"But there are many wars with genocides, and we do not talk about that," she continued, adding: "So this is a very complicated question and I think it's a bit unfair asking us what do you think, how we support, not support, talking to our governments or not."


Wim Wenders concluded the discussion on the topic by stating: "We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics; but we are the counterweight to politics."

"Cinema has an incredible power of being compassionate and empathetic," he also said. "The news is not empathetic. Politics is not empathetic, but movies are. And that's our duty."

The feed remained offline for the entirety of the answers given by Puszczynska and Wenders, but many other news cameras documented the exchange.

Beyond the interruption in the livestream, Jung feels the jury's answers are "questionable."

"A major film festival should not have opened like this," he told DW.

In 2024, Wenders had told press agency dpa on the Berlinale's red carpet that he liked how the festival always took a stance, and that "it would keep on doing so in the future." At the time, the filmmaker was reacting to the festival's decision to disinvite five politicians from the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) from the opening gala.

For the past two years, several filmmakers have made political statements regarding the conflict in Gaza, and the Berlin Film Festival has faced criticism from different sides over how it has handled the sensitive topic.

On the one hand, it is accused of avoiding showing solidarity with Palestinians, and on the other, it has been accused of antisemitism for offering a stage to critical voices.

Criticism of Israel's policies by an Israeli filmmaker were among the 2024 incidents that led to the festival being accused of antisemitism.

Yuval Abraham, the Israeli co-director of the documentary "No Other Land," which portrays the situation in the occupied West Bank, went on to face death threats in his home country following his call at the festival's award ceremony to end "this apartheid, this inequality."

Ahead of the 2025 event — Tricia Tuttle's first year as its director — the festival clarified its position on freedom of expression, including showing solidarity with Palestinians: "All of the guests have a right to free speech within the bounds of the law. We also stand by the right of our filmmakers to talk about the impulses behind their work and their experiences of the world. The Berlinale welcomes different points of view, even if this creates tension or controversy."

Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych pushed at the limits of the International Olympic Committee's rules on freedom of expression, and the global sports body pushed back. That created an emotional and historic moment of Winter Games lore.

Heraskevych insisted on wearing a helmet in competition with the images of Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed during Russia's nearly 4-year-old full-scale invasion of their country. By refusing to back down, he was disqualified from his Olympic event Thursday.

He defied a last-minute plea by IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was in tears after their early morning meeting at the sliding center in Cortina d’Ampezzo. Although disqualified from the competition, Heraskevych was not expelled from the Olympics, unlike previous athletes who staged prominent protests.

A look at the Olympic rules and previous protests:

Heraskevych had freely worn his preferred helmet on training runs, and the IOC told him he could bring it to media areas on race days.

For the actual race, however, he refused to wear an approved helmet that complied with IOC rules designed to keep the field of competition clean of political messages. Heraskevych also refused proposed IOC compromises of wearing a black armband or displaying the helmet once he was off the course.

Political neutrality is a foundational principle of the Olympic Charter, a 108-page document of 61 articles that effectively serves as the constitution of the IOC and the Olympic Games.

Rule 50 states: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”

In addition, Rule 40 states that athletes comply with “conditions of participation established by the IOC,” including where and how free expression can be displayed.

“It is not at all about the message,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a daily news conference dominated by the helmet issue. “It is simply about the sanctity of the field of play.”

Sports law expert Antoine Duval told The Associated Press it was “a huge move” for the IOC to cite Rule 40 on free expression and not the one on political propaganda.

“That is demanding that athletes are like absolute robots,” said Duval of the Asser Institute in the Netherlands, suggesting future Olympians could face scrutiny over their tattoos.

Heraskevych, 27, is at his third Winter Games and the second under the shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine, which began Feb. 24, 2022 — four days after the end of the Beijing Winter Games.

On Feb. 11 of that year, Heraskevych completed his races in China and held a small sign for the TV cameras in the blue and yellow colors of his national flag with the slogan, “No War in Ukraine.”

The IOC took no action against him, deciding this was “a general call for peace” and not an explicitly political statement.

He returned to the Olympics this year, with no end to the war in sight, and he again tried to state his views.

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

The risks of the competition being overshadowed by political statements could be even greater at the larger Summer Games like those in 2028 in Los Angeles, when the IOC wants 206 national Olympic teams, plus a refugee team, to take part.

“Think of the Middle East, think of Africa, think of South America, if everyone is allowed to express themselves in that way beyond a black armband,” Adams said “You can see where that would lead to a chaotic situation.”

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

A regular concern at Summer Games in recent years has been the issue of some athletes seeming to be pulled from competition to avoid facing an opponent from Israel.

The last major review of protest guidelines was overseen by Coventry while she was an IOC athlete representative ahead of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.

Stricter rules were in place but eased just weeks before those Games, in which women's soccer teams took a knee before the first whistle to support racial justice.

Heraskevych’s case has been compared to U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov, who made an emotional tribute in Milan this week. After his skate, he displayed a photo of himself as a child with his parents, who were killed in January 2025 when American Airlines Flight 5342 struck a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River.

Adams said Naumov's display was “a spontaneous show of emotion” after his event.

At the Paris Olympics 18 months ago, Afghan refugee Manizha Talash competed in the breaking competition wearing a cape with the slogan, “Free Afghan Women.” She was disqualified by the World DanceSport Federation.

Also in Paris, the opening ceremony saw a memorial gesture in which Algerian athletes tossed red roses from their boat into the Seine at the spot where in 1961 dozens of protesters died in a police crackdown.

Perhaps the most famous demonstration came at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City when U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood atop the medal podium after the 200 meters race. Shoeless and with their heads bowed, the two Black Americans each raised a gloved fist to protest racial injustice. They were expelled from the Games but allowed to keep their medals.

The helmet issue has put Ukraine back in the Olympic news at what could be the last games before Russia returns to the IOC fold. Russian athletes and teams have faced varying restrictions on competing — without their national identity of flag, anthem and colors — at each Olympics in the past decade because of doping scandals and the war.

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for breaking the Olympic Charter by incorporating sports councils in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed. The legal dispute is under review, and the IOC advised sports governing bodies in December to look at restoring Russian youth teams to international competitions with their full identity.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi has urged the IOC not to make concessions before the war ends.

The legal dispute is under review, and the IOC advised sports governing bodies in December to look at restoring Russian youth teams to international competitions with their full identity.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi has urged the IOC not to make concessions before the war ends.
