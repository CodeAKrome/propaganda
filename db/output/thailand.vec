'I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy,' Lewis McClelland said

A British tourist is stranded in Thailand after a horror moped crash left his leg "hanging off" to end his two-week trip of relaxation in a “nightmare”.

Lewis McClelland and his friend rented bikes for a morning ride to the beach on February 2, colliding with a tuk-tuk, which "ripped through his leg”.

The 30-year-old travelled to Ko Lanta on January 16 to relax before starting a new job as a window fitter.

Horrifying photos show the tourist lying on the floor after the accident, with his leg visibly torn open, later rushed to hospital to be stitched up to stop the extreme bleeding.

Mr McClelland suffered multiple open fractures to his leg, fractures in his wrist and fingers, and facial lacerations leading to reconstructive surgery.

The window fitter claims Post Office travel insurance is refusing to cover his medical bills and repatriation back home, as he did not have a compulsory basic training (CBT) certificate for riding the moped.

However, he says he was only required to hand over his passport to the moped rental company and there was no mention of a CBT certificate, warning other tourists to be wary.

A GoFundMe page has been set up by Mr McClelland's mum to raise funds to help cover the upwards of £20,000 in medical bills and get him safely back home.

Donations can be made here.

Mr McClelland, who lives in Portsmouth, Hampshire, said: "This relaxing trip I never would've thought would turn into such a nightmare. It was horrific.

"I was meant to be just going for two weeks on a holiday. Just to get away from life for a bit. It was terrible and a big blur in the moment.

“I can't really remember because of the concussion afterwards. I'm still lucky to have my leg. My wrist snapped and two fingers snapped. I've got life-changing scars now all across my face.

Lewis McClelland received roadside treatment by first responders

"I pretty much ripped the bottom of my leg off to the point there was no pulse in my foot. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."

The holidaymaker was rushed to A&E where he received stitches to stop him bleeding out before being transferred to another hospital for reconstructive surgery.

He now has an external fixator holding his leg together and is waiting for a second surgery before he can fly back home.

"I'm very lucky to be alive,” he added, “if they didn't act so quickly, I would've bled out. There was no way around it. It was a very, very close call.

"It's a life changing position for me. My face is lacerated and I'm quite a self-conscious person as it is.

"I was due to start my dream job when I got back. You couldn't write it."

Mr McClelland warned other holidaymakers to "read the small print” and make sure to carry a drivers licence at all times.

The Post Office has been contacted for comment.

Title: ‘India scores low on partner satisfaction, but ranks 8th for romance, intimacy’

Text: India may be home to centuries-old love poetry, temple carvings celebrating intimacy, and the world’s most quoted ancient text on desire,  but when it comes to modern relationship satisfaction, the picture is more complex.

According to the Ipsos Valentine’s Day survey, conducted across 29 global markets, India ranks lowest in partner satisfaction and sits among the bottom three countries on the Love Life Satisfaction Index 2026.

Reason? “There is a notable gap between relationship expectations and lived experiences among Indian respondents,” reveals the survey.

The Love Life Satisfaction Index is not a vague, feel-good metric. It combines three specific dimensions: satisfaction with the love in one’s life, satisfaction with one’s sex life, and satisfaction with one’s relationship with a spouse or partner.

In other words, it attempts to measure not just romance or chemistry, but emotional connection, physical intimacy and relational stability together. And here’s where the paradox begins.

Two in three Indians (67%) describe their relationship with their spouse or partner as loving. That’s not a small number. In absolute terms, a majority report positive emotional connection.

Yet when compared globally, India ranks lowest on partner satisfaction. It also falls among the bottom three markets when respondents were asked whether they feel loved.

That gap — between “my relationship is loving” and “I feel loved” — may be subtle, but it is significant. It hints at something deeper than relationship status: perceived emotional reciprocity.

Ipsos India CEO Suresh Ramalingam cautions against reading the findings as a crisis. “Two in three Indians report being satisfied with their love life. The ranking is relative across markets and should be interpreted in context,” he notes.

India’s ranking feels jarring against its global image. The land of the Kamasutra, Bollywood romance and elaborate wedding rituals is culturally synonymous with passion and intimacy.

But modern love doesn’t unfold in mythology.

Multi-generational family systems, rising work pressures, dual-income households, shifting gender roles and evolving expectations within marriages may all shape how people experience emotional fulfilment today. Balancing caregiving, careers and partnership leaves less space for overt affirmation — even if affection exists. Love may be present. But is it felt and expressed?

Interestingly, India performs far better when it comes to romance and sex life satisfaction. The country ranks 8th overall among 29 markets on this dimension — ahead of several Western nations.

Thailand and Indonesia lead the category, followed by Mexico, Spain, Malaysia, Colombia, Peru, India and Argentina.

This contrast suggests something important: emotional validation and physical intimacy do not always move together. People may feel reasonably satisfied with romance and sexual connection, yet still report lower levels of feeling emotionally affirmed.

Thailand tops the overall Love Life Satisfaction Index in 2026, with respondents reporting high satisfaction across all three dimensions. Countries across Asia, Latin America and parts of Europe dominate the upper tier.

At the bottom sit Japan, South Korea and India. Even Italy and France — long associated with romance — appear in the bottom ten, proving that cultural stereotypes don’t always mirror lived experience.

Across 29 markets, income appears to influence love life satisfaction. Eighty-two per cent of high-income respondents say they are satisfied with the love in their life, compared to 72% of low-income respondents. When it comes to romantic and sex life satisfaction, the gap widens to 14 percentage points.

Money may not buy love, but financial stability seems to reduce stressors that strain relationships. The survey, based on over 23,000 respondents globally, including around 2,200 in India, ultimately reveals that love is multi-dimensional. Emotional fulfilment, romance and physical intimacy are distinct — and sometimes misaligned. For India, the findings are less about a deficit of love and more about evolving expectations. In a rapidly changing society, how love is expressed — and how it is perceived — may be shifting just as quickly.

Title: BJP starts process to cancel Rahul Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership

Text: 





















Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday said that he has submitted a notice in the Lok Sabha to initiate a substantive motion against Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi for allegedly “fomenting public sentiments” in Parliament through foreign funding, reported The Indian Express.


Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Dubey said that he has sought the cancellation of Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership. “He should be debarred from contesting the election for a lifetime,” The Indian Express quoted him as saying.

Dubey also said that he had not moved a privilege motion against Gandhi.

A privilege motion is brought when a member believes that the privileges of the House or of its members have been breached. It is examined by the speaker. If admitted, it may be referred to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry.

In his notice, the BJP MP said that Gandhi has engaged with the Soros Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development, and travelled to countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the United States to take part in “anti-India activities”, The Indian Express reported.

Dubey alleged in the notice that Gandhi has “very cleverly…captured the most pious dais of Parliament to foment public sentiments, levelling unsubstantiated allegations…against the Election Commission…[and] Supreme Court…lowering the dignity of the government without any substantive evidence and putting various other institutions in bad light”, the newspaper reported.


Dubey said that Gandhi’s “relentless and well-choreographed actions, within and outside Parliament, are inimical to our country”, The Indian Express reported.

In response, Congress leader KC Venugopal told the newspaper that Dubey’s move was an attempt to divert attention from the matters Gandhi had raised. “It’s self-defence for the BJP,” The Indian Express quoted Venugopal as saying.

On Wednesday, Gandhi participated in the debate on the Union Budget. He alleged that the BJP-led Union government had “sold Bharat Mata” through the trade deal between India and the United States.










The former Army chief wrote in his memoir that this implied that the Indian response was to be “purely a military decision” and that “the onus was now totally on [him]”.


BJP MPs had been objecting to the Congress MP speaking on the matter, arguing that he cannot quote from a book that had not yet been released.

Text: 





















Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Thursday asserted that he will “not budge” and will continue to speak up for farmers regardless of any legal or parliamentary action against him, following a notice from Bharatiya Janata MP Nishikant Dubey seeking his expulsion through a substantive motion.

“Narendra Modi has sold the country and its farmers,” Gandhi said in a video posted on social media. “You put cases against me, abuse me. Do whatever you want, file a privilege motion, it does not matter to me, I have spoken the truth in Parliament, you may not like it, that is a different matter, but the country knows the truth.”

He accused Modi of being “anti-farmer”, and of “selling” the interests of the country in the trade deal with the United States.

Gandhi has alleged that in the recently-announced trade deal, the BJP-led Union government compromised India’s energy security and harmed farmers’ interests.

Text: As BJP MP Nishikant Dubey gave notice Thursday for a substantive motion against Rahul Gandhi seeking his “immediate expulsion” from Lok Sabha, the Leader of Opposition again targeted the Prime Minister and the government over the trade deal with the US and told them “do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers” and “will not budge even an inch”.

Gandhi’s remarks came a day after he mounted a sharp attack on the government in Lok Sabha, accusing it of compromising India’s energy security and farm interests in the trade deal with the US.

On Thursday, BJP’s Dubey submitted a notice on a substantive motion, seeking Gandhi’s “immediate expulsion” from the Lok Sabha after initiating an “inquiry to examine all his unethical conduct”. He later raised the matter in the House.

The substantive motion is a rarely used tool in the legislative body to ensure a discussion and voting on the motion if it is accepted.

In Lok Sabha, Dubey said, “Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi behaves like an urban Naxal and he has relations with the Soros Foundation and Ford Foundation. He goes on meeting anti-nationals in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bahrain. He raises allegations sometimes against the Election Commission, Constitutional authorities, Speaker and sometimes the Supreme Court. There should be a discussion on the substantive motion, his membership should be cancelled and he should not be allowed to contest election ever… Yeh desh ko tukde tukde karna chahta hai (He wants to break the nation).”

His remarks led to a ruckus with Opposition MPs protesting. Krishna Prasad Tenneti, who was chairing the proceedings, adjourned the House for the day.

In his notice, Dubey said Gandhi, with the help of foreign organisations, has “very cleverly able to capture the most pious dais of Parliament to foment public sentiments, levelling unsubstantiated allegations not only against the Election Commission of India but even our Honourable Supreme Court of India, lowering the dignity of the Government without any substantive evidence and putting various others institutions in bad light”.

He alleged that Gandhi had entered into the “world of unethical conduct” and had become a major constituent of the “Thuggery Gang to destabilise India from within”. He said his “relentless and well-choreographed actions, within and outside Parliament, are inimical to our country, a serious aspect of discussion in the entire nook and corner of the country”.

Dubey also clarified that he had not moved a privilege motion against Gandhi, but given notice for a substantive motion.

Meanwhile, government sources said there has been no decision on moving a privilege motion against Rahul Gandhi, but it will seek the removal from House records of more words and lines from the speech that Gandhi has not authenticated.

Gandhi hit back, saying he will stand firmly with farmers. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “opened doors for foreigners looking to capture our agriculture market for years”.

In a video statement, Gandhi said even if an FIR or case is registered, or a privilege motion brought, he will continue to fight for the farmers.

He accused Modi of being “anti-farmer”, of “selling” the country in the deal with the US, and of being in a “chokehold”.

“The Congress fought for food security and Narendra Modi has betrayed our food security and our farmers. By striking a deal with the US, he has sold cotton, soya, apple and fruit farmers. Since years, foreigners have been trying to capture our agriculture market,” Gandhi said.

“This is the truth, he (Modi) also knows this… Narendra Modi’s reins are in the hands of (US President) Donald Trump,” he said.

Gandhi said Modi had earlier brought the “black farm laws” and had now opened the doors of the agriculture market to foreign powers.

“American farmers have farm lands that are in acres, it is all mechanised and the government gives them subsidy. On the other hand, the farms of our farmers are small, they don’t get MSP and there is no mechanisation,” he said.

“Narendra Modi has sold the country and its farmers. You put cases against me, abuse me. Do whatever you want, file a privilege motion, it does not matter to me, I have spoken the truth in Parliament, you may not like it, that is a different matter, but the country knows the truth. Do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers. I will not budge even an inch,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Gandhi, responding to questions on the substantive motion, said the media was doing “a disservice to the country” by taking a “keyword” from “the government and running shows on that”.
