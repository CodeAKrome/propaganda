South Korea's espionage agency, the National Intelligence Service, informed lawmakers Thursday that it thinks North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's teenage daughter is near to being set apart as the regime's future leader, The Associated Press reported.

Kim is the third generation of men in his family to rule North Korea.

In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.

"In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that’s quite significant," Lee noted, according to the outlet.

In 2023, South Korea's National Intelligence Service indicated to lawmakers that the North Korean leader and his wife probably had an older son as well as a younger, third child of unknown gender, according to The Associated Press.

North Korea is one of the world's few nuclear-armed nations, making it a unique threat on the global stage.

A 2025 U.S. Intelligence Community Annual Threat Assessment stated, "Kim remains committed to increasing the number of North Korea’s nuclear warheads and improving its missile capabilities to threaten the Homeland and U.S. forces, citizens, and allies, and to weaken U.S. power in the AsiaPacific region, as evidenced by the pace of the North’s missile flight tests and the regime’s public touting of its uranium enrichment capabilities."

"Russia is increasingly supporting North Korea’s nuclear status in exchange for Pyongyang's support to Moscow’s war against Ukraine," the assessment noted.

Text: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has selected his daughter as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday.

Kim Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - has in recent months been pictured beside her father in high-profile events like a visit to Beijing in September, her first known trip abroad.

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a "range of circumstances" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events" in making this assessment.

The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.

The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.

On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being "trained" to be a successor, was now at the stage of "successor designation".

"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor," Lee said.

Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.

News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he "held baby Ju Ae" during a trip to the secretive state.

Ju Ae made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand.

She has since made frequent appearances on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator.  She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.

She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.

Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader.

The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.

In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him.

In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.

Although the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.

It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society.

Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.

Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.

However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.

It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea.

Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father.

Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.

Deepak Kumar's confronting of Hindu vigilantes is being hailed as a rare act of heroism. It's also got him death threats.

The fishing boat tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection inside Japan's territorial waters, authorities say.

Voters are hoping for a return to democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina.

Zhang Youxia, widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was in January removed from his post.

A gunman who laid siege to the school shot the principal and another female student who is out of danger.

Text: South Korea’s spy agency says it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader

SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader as he moves to extend the family dynasty to a fourth generation.

The assessment by the National Intelligence Service comes as North Korea is preparing to hold its biggest political conference later this month, where Kim is expected to outline his major policy goals for the next five years and take steps to tighten his authoritarian grip.

In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.

First appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has since accompanied her father to an increasing number of events, including weapons tests, military parades and factory openings. She traveled with him to Beijing last September for Kim's first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years on the sidelines of a World War II event.

Speculation about her political future intensified last month when she joined her parents on a New Year’s Day visit to Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a sacred family mausoleum displaying the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather, the country’s first- and second-generation leaders. Some experts saw the visit as the clearest sign yet that she’s positioned to be the heir to her 42-year-old father.

South Korean officials initially expressed doubt that she could be chosen as a North Korean leader, citing the country’s deeply conservative culture and tradition of male-dominated leadership. But her increasingly prominent appearances in state media have prompted a reassessment.

In its previous assessment of Kim Ju Ae’s status in September, the NIS told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un’s decision to bring her along on his trip to China was likely part of an effort to build a “narrative” possibly paving the way for her succession.

“In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that's quite significant,” Lee said.

According to Lee, the agency cited her growing presence at high-profile military events, her inclusion in the family visit to Kumsusan, and signs that Kim Jong Un was beginning to seek her input on certain policy matters.

Despite her increased visibility in propaganda, North Korean state media have never published the name of Kim Jong Un’s daughter, only referring to her as his “respected” or “most beloved” child.

The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA star Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding Kim Jong Un’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013. South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born sometime that year.

In 2023, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un and his wife also likely have an older son and a younger third child whose gender is unknown.

Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been ruled by male members of the Kim family, beginning with the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and followed by his son, Kim Jong Il.

Kim Jong Un was just 26 when he was officially named heir during a 2010 party conference, two years after Kim Jong Il suffered a debilitating stroke. Following his father’s death in December 2011, he was abruptly thrust into the throne with relatively little preparation.

Some analysts suggest that Kim Jong Un’s decision to debut his daughter early possibly reflects his own experience of being rushed into power.

Kim Ju Ae’s first known visit to Kumsusan last month was also her father’s first visit to the site in three years. Given the palace’s status as a key symbol of the Kim family rule, the trip should be seen as a symbolic gesture by Kim Jong Un to present his daughter as his heir before his grandfather and father as he prepares for the major ruling party congress, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.

The Workers’ Party congress in late February, last held in 2016 and 2021, could provide a stage for Kim Jong Un to formalize his succession plans, possibly by giving his daughter the party’s first secretary post, its No. 2 job, although such a decision might not be immediately disclosed to the outside world, Cheong said.

Other analysts question whether she would receive such a high-profile post or any formal party role, given that party rules require members to be at least 18.

If Kim Jong Un does use the party congress to cement his daughter as successor, the signs would be more subtle, said Koh Yu-hwan, former president of South Korea’s Institute of National Unification.

For example, the party may issue self-praise about how North Korea has survived longer than most other Communist states and credit that to how the country established a "successful inheritance of the revolution,” he said.

“If you see comments like that, it would be reasonable to think that Ju Ae has been cemented,” as heir, Koh said.

Text: Kim Ju Ae, the daughter of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, is estimated to be around 13 years old. She has already appeared by her father's side at military events.

Kim Jong Un's teenage daughter is close to being designated as his successor to lead North Korea, according to South Korea's spy agency.

South Korean lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun on Thursday shared details from a closed-door briefing with Seoul's National Intelligence Agency (NIS).

"In the past, the NIS described Kim Ju Ae as being 'in study as successor' but today the ‌expression used was that she 'was in the stage of being internally appointed ‌successor'," he told reporters.

Lee said the NIS is "taking into account a range of circumstances — including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events."

Little information has been officially confirmed about Kim Ju Ae, but she has increasingly appeared beside her father at high-profile engagements in North Korea, beginning with a long-range missile test in 2022.

Her name was made known in the West by American basketball icon Dennis Rodman, who visited Pyongyang in 2013.

She is believed to be around 13 years old.

Lee, the South Korean lawmaker who shared details of the intelligence briefing on Thursday, said there were signs that Kim Ju Ae had started to weigh in on policy decisions.

Some experts also believe that Kim Jong Un may have other children, including a son who has not been presented to the public.

North Korea's ruling Workers' Party will hold a landmark congress at the end of February, where it is expected to lay out its foreign policy and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.

Seoul's spy agency said it would closely monitor Ju Ae's attendance, including what level of protocol is accorded to her.

Kim Ju Ae, 13, is set to become the reclusive state’s first female leader, South Korean intelligence has claimed

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has chosen his teenage daughter to succeed him as ruler of the hermit kingdom, South Korea’s intelligence agency has claimed.

The National Intelligence Service assessed that Kim Ju Ae, believed to be around 13 years old, has moved from being groomed for leadership to formally designated heir.

Officials cited her increasing visibility at major state events and signs she has begun contributing to policy discussions.

Her September trip to Beijing marked her first confirmed overseas visit, where she accompanied her father at a large-scale military parade.

South Korean lawmaker Park Sun-won said her increasing public role suggests she is effectively being treated as the regime’s second most powerful figure.

The world first became aware of Ms Ju Ae in 2013 when former NBA star Dennis Rodman told The Guardian he had held the baby during a visit to the secretive state.

She remained out of sight until 2022, when North Korean state television showed her inspecting an intercontinental ballistic missile with her father.

Since then, she has appeared frequently in official media, often pictured in designer clothing and styled hair - luxuries out of reach for ordinary citizens.

During her Beijing visit, she was seen stepping off her father’s armoured train at the capital’s railway station ahead of what was billed as China’s largest military parade.

Recent images show her walking alongside - rather than behind - her father, a symbolic shift in a regime where positioning carries meaning.

Lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen said the intelligence service had upgraded its assessment from “trained” successor to formal designation.

“As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor,” Mr Seong-kwen said.

The agency will closely watch whether she appears at the upcoming Workers’ Party congress, Pyongyang’s most significant political event, where key foreign policy and military priorities are set.

Her selection raises eyebrows in a society known for deeply entrenched patriarchal norms, with analysts previously considering female leadership in North Korea unlikely.

However, Mr Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo Jong already holds a senior role within the Workers’ Party Central Committee and is widely viewed as one of the regime’s most powerful figures.

Why the North Korean dictator, still relatively young and said to be in good health, would name a 13-year-old heir remains unclear.

Ms Ju Ae is the only publicly acknowledged child of Mr Jong-un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju.

Should the 13-year-old assume power, she would become only the fourth leader of the reclusive state since the Korean peninsula was divided at the end of the Second World War.

Kim Il Sung founded North Korea and ruled from 1948 until his death in 1994, posthumously declared as the country's Eternal President.

He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-il, who remained in power until 2011.

Mr Jong-un then assumed control at just 27 years old.
