   * Amid the Sino‑Japanese friction, Japan is pursuing “shuttle diplomacy” with South Korea.  
   * Analysts note that Takaichi’s “responsible” fiscal stance is helping the yen gain value.  
   * China summoned Japan’s ambassador, warned its citizens, and the Chinese tourism market to Japan shrank sharply.  
   * In February 2026, Japan seized a Chinese fishing vessel that had fled inspection in the Japanese EEZ— the first such seizure since 2022—bringing the tension back to a concrete enforcement incident.
   * Safe‑haven currency rankings (USD, CHF, JPY) are being re‑evaluated as market dynamics shift.
   * Takaichi is slated for a March trip to South Korea, potentially aligning with her U.S. visit on March 19.  
   * Takaichi’s November 2025 comments about a military response to a hypothetical Chinese Taiwan invasion triggered a full‑blown diplomatic spat.  
   * The Korean side is also contemplating hosting the meeting in Lee Jae‑Myung’s hometown of Andong, indicating an attempt to keep diplomatic channels open.
   * The main opposition (Centrist Reform Alliance) has elected a new leader, Junya Ogawa, as they prepare for a special session to re‑elect Takaichi.  
   * The ruling LDP, led by Takaichi, won a landslide in the July 2025 lower‑house election.  
   * The yen’s volatility is partly tied to her policy decisions and the overall geopolitical climate.  
   * These internal politics give Takaichi the domestic mandate to act aggressively on foreign policy.
- **China** remains highly reactive to any perceived provocation, and the recent incident underscores the delicate balance Japan must maintain in its maritime enforcement and diplomatic messaging.  
- **Economically**, the political developments are influencing the yen’s trajectory and the broader perception of safe‑haven currencies.
- **Sanae Takaichi** is simultaneously consolidating domestic power, engaging in high‑profile diplomatic visits (South Korea, U.S.) and handling a fresh confrontation with China that has already manifested in a concrete enforcement action (seizure of a Chinese fishing vessel).  
- **South Korea** is a key partner in a “shuttle diplomacy” strategy that seeks to keep communication channels open amid the Sino‑Japanese friction.
