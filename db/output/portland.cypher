1. **Timing** – The surge began late 2025; the drawdown and policy shifts unfolded in early 2026.  
2. **Actors** – Tom Homan (border czar) and Gov. Tim Walz were central to the political back‑and‑forth.  
3. **Controversy** – Two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens (Good, Pretti) were the flashpoints that fueled protests and legal action.  
4. **Sanctuary stance** – Fox Politics presents a stark anti‑sanctuary narrative, claiming that sanctuary policies allowed a serious criminal to roam.  
5. **Policy outcomes** – BBC reports a partial drawdown and highlights both successes (arrests of many undocumented immigrants) and harms (civil‑rights concerns, economic damage).
