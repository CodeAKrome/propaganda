* **Anti‑Suppression Argument** – Democrats, civil‑rights groups and many legal scholars contend that the Act would disenfranchise millions of Americans who lack ready proof of citizenship or a photo ID—especially low‑income voters, seniors and people of color.  They also point out that most states already require photo ID and that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States.
* **Pro‑Fraud Argument** – Republicans, the Trump administration and many conservatives say the Act is a necessary safeguard against “voter fraud” and illegal voting by non‑citizens.
**What is the SAVE America Act?**
### Bottom line
### Political status
### Public opinion
### Why the bill matters
| **Name‑change safeguards** | For people who change their name (e.g., marriage) the bill allows the submission of extra documentation to verify identity. | It tries to reduce confusion for those whose legal name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport. |
| **Penalties for officials** | If a county clerk or other election official registers a voter without the required proof of citizenship, they can face criminal charges. | This creates a legal deterrent for non‑compliance. |
| **Photo ID at the polls** | Every voter must produce a government‑issued photo ID (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) on election day. | Election officials will check the ID against the voter’s registration record and the ID’s validity before allowing a ballot to be cast. |
| **Proof of citizenship at registration** | Voters must show a U.S. passport **or** a birth‑certificate that is issued by a state or U.S. authority. | The voter’s application would be blocked unless the document is presented and verified before the voter is added to the roll. |
| House | Senate |
| Key opponents | House Democrats, Senate Democrats, many civil‑rights groups, some independent voters |
| Key supporters | House Republicans, President Trump, most Senate Republicans |
| Passed 218‑213 (mostly along party lines) | Still pending; no Senate vote yet.  The bill needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, but the current Republican caucus has far fewer.  Some GOP senators (e.g., Lisa Murkowski) have said they would not support it. |
| Provision | What it requires | How it would work |

A 2025 Pew Research Center poll found that **83 %** of Americans favored requiring all voters to present a government‑issued photo ID, with 95 % of Republicans and 71 % of Democrats in favour.  However, many of those who would be affected by the bill have not been fully surveyed.
The *Safeguard American Voter Eligibility* (SAVE) Act is a federal bill that would tighten voter‑registration rules and the voting process.  Its key provisions are:
The SAVE Act is **not law yet**.  It has passed the House but is stalled in the Senate where it faces a lack of majority support and significant opposition on grounds that it would disenfranchise eligible voters.  If enacted, it would impose strict citizenship verification at registration and mandatory photo ID at the polls, and would bring new penalties for non‑compliant election officials.
