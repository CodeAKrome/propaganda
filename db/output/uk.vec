Text: Dozens of grief-stricken parents held a demonstration outside the corporate offices of Snapchat in Santa Monica, California, on Feb. 12, urging more action to protect young users of the popular social media platform.

Organizers said 43 parents participated, coming from multiple U.S. states; one came from the UK. Demonstrators held placards, sang, gave speeches, and painted names of 108 deceased children on the public roadway in large white letters. Those actions were taken to create “a memorial to honor their kids and call for stronger safety measures from the company,” a news release said.

Nearly all the participants were parents of youths who died from pills poisoned with fentanyl; those parents allege their children obtained those deadly doses from drug dealers on Snapchat. Some of the participants, including Amy Neville, are part of a lawsuit that remains pending against the social media platform. That suit alleges Snapchat is a defective product and that its design is faulty.

Neville’s son, Alexander, was a 14-year-old Snapchat user when fentanyl killed him in 2020. He obtained the pill from a dealer on Snapchat, his mother said. She has been on a crusade ever since, seeking to inform parents, pressure companies to change, and forge changes in laws.

“I think our children were honored beautifully today, in a way that sent a message to Snapchat and other social media companies. ... Safety has to be the priority,” Neville told The Epoch Times after the demonstration concluded.

Downing Street has welcomed Sir Jim's apology

Nigel Farage has launched a sharp rebuke against Sir Keir Starmer following the Prime Minister's demand that Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe apologise for claiming Britain had been "colonised" by migrants.

The Reform UK leader accused the Labour government of turning a blind eye to the scale of demographic change across the country.

"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country," Mr Farage declared.


The row erupted following an interview in which the Indeos founder made controversial statements about immigration levels and their impact on public finances.

Speaking to Sky News at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, Sir Jim warned that Britain faces serious political, social and economic challenges, with immigration levels being a central concern.

"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in," the chemicals tycoon stated. "I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money."

The Manchester United part-owner went further, claiming: "The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people."

Nigel Farage spoke in favour of Sir Jim

The Prime Minister's spokesman confirmed that Downing Street was satisfied with the apology that followed.

They told reporters: "The Prime Minister asked for an apology, and one's been issued, and it's absolutely right that Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for that language."

Downing Street maintained that while serious discussion about immigration policy was welcome, Sir Jim's original comments were "inflammatory and divisive."

In his statement, Sir Jim said: "I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth,"

The billionaire explained his remarks were made during discussions about economic growth, jobs and manufacturing at the Antwerp summit, adding: "It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK."

The political fallout drew responses from across the spectrum.  Chancellor Rachel Reeves took a far harsher view, describing the comments as "unacceptable" and "disgusting, frankly."

Despite her criticism, Ms Reeves indicated the government would continue supporting Sir Jim's businesses at Grangemouth and Runcorn, stating she would not "let what Jim Ratcliffe has said determine the future of jobs in Scotland."

The Chancellor emphasised that Britain "benefits hugely from its diversity" across business, universities and cultural life.

Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride offered a more nuanced Conservative response, rejecting the term "colonised" as "pejorative" while acknowledging that "migration has been too high for too long."

Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper also called for an apology, describing Sir Jim's language as "wholly inappropriate."

Former Prime Minister Liz Truss said: "Let's see him and fellow business leaders step up and help fix the country.

"We need their skills. In particular they need to replace the senior bureaucrats who have failed."

The Manchester United co-owner said he wanted to 'raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration'

Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for his comments where he claimed Britain is "colonised" by immigrants.

In a statement, the Manchester United co-owner said: "I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe."

He added: "It is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth."

Sir Jim was met with major backlash from politicians, with Sir Keir Starmer calling on him to apologise.

Sir Jim added: "My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.

"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone.

"It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK."

GB News understands the Football Association will examine whether Sir Jim's initial comments "brought the game into disrepute" and breached regulations.

Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for his comments

Football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out has already condemned the comments.

They said: "Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s comments are disgraceful and deeply divisive at a time when football does so much to bring communities together.

"In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it’s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fan base and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.

"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football and we believe most fans will feel the same."

Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised

Sir Mel Stride criticised the businessman’s claims, while acknowledging people’s concerns around "too high” migration.

The Shadow Chancellor said: "I wouldn’t use that term colonised. I think it’s pejorative and suggests there’s some kind of huge negativity around the motivations of those people that come here.

"I don’t think that’s the case across the piece.

"But he is referencing something that is of great concern to millions of people up and down the country, that migration has been too high for too long."

Sir Jim came under fire for his comments

However Sir Jim was praised by former Prime Minister Liz Truss and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.

Ms Truss said: "Let's see him and fellow business leaders step up and help fix the country. We need their skills. In particular they need to replace the senior bureaucrats who have failed."

Responding to the Prime Minister's call for Sir Jim to apologise, Mr Farage said: "Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.

The billionaire co-owner of the Manchester United soccer team apologized Thursday after he triggered a storm of criticism by saying that Britain had been “colonized” by immigrants.

The original comments from Jim Ratcliffe, who is also the founder and chairman of chemicals maker Ineos, had drawn a swift rebuke from Prime Minister Keir Starmer who described them as “offensive and wrong.” That sentiment was seconded by many soccer fans and figures across the spectrum of UK politics.

The controversial remarks came in a wide-ranging interview with Sky News in which Ratcliffe touched on the challenges facing the European chemicals industry, politics and the weakness of the UK economy. They were a top news story in Britain where his position as one of the country’s richest people and the co-owner of one of its most successful soccer clubs make him an influential voice on politics and the economy.

Ratcliffe said Thursday that he had intended to stress the need for governments to manage migration and invest in the economy to ensure “long-term prosperity is shared by everyone.

“I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern,” he said in a statement. “But it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.”

Ratcliffe’s comments touched a nerve in Britain, where immigration is a divisive issue. While many people celebrate the contributions of immigrants, others complain that the newcomers are straining public services and failing to integrate into British society.

The upstart Reform Party and its leader, Nigel Farage, have used anti-immigrant policies to push their way into the mainstream of British politics. Reform, which won just five seats in Parliament in 2024, now leads most nationwide opinion polls.

Starmer’s left-leaning Labour Party won a landslide victory in that election but is now fighting for survival after a series of policy missteps and its failure to prevent thousands of asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel on inflatable boats. The prime minister took to social media late Wednesday to criticize Ratcliffe.

“Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country,’’ Starmer said on X. “Jim Ratcliffe should apologize.”

Even the team itself felt it necessary to issue a statement given the backlash, insisting it is an “inclusive and welcoming club” with a “diverse group of players.”

Others accused Ratcliffe of “hypocrisy” because he has chosen to make his home in Monaco to reduce his UK tax bill.

“There’s also something that I find quite offensive, that this man who moved to Monaco to save 4 billion pounds ($5.46 billion) in tax is now lecturing us about immigration,” Justice Minister Jake Richards told Times Radio.

Ratcliffe told Sky News that the UK has “lots of problems,” including a weak economy, crime and a struggling health care system. The government won’t be able to control immigration or deal with the problem of people choosing to live on social welfare payments rather than work for a living unless it is willing to make difficult choices, he said.

“You can’t have an economy with 9 million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,” Ratcliffe said. “I mean, the UK’s been colonized.”

The use of the word “colonized’’ is problematic because it suggests immigrants are taking over, said Sunder Katwala, head of the think tank Britain First, which studies public attitudes on immigration and integration. This is particularly true in Britain, which is re-examining its own history as a nation that once colonized large parts of the world.

“I think the language of colonized is that (of) dominance, subjugation, dispossession,’’ Katwala told the BBC. “It’s very hard to have that debate in a way that makes sense to all the different kinds of people in Britain — white, Black and Asian — rather than seeming to be an argument about one group against another group.”

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said that his city in northern England is a place where people of all races and backgrounds have “pulled together” to build the community and institutions like Manchester United.

“Calling for curbs on levels of immigration is one thing, portraying those who come here as a hostile invading force is quite another,” Burnham wrote on X. “It is inaccurate, insulting and inflammatory and should be withdrawn.”

“If any criticism is needed, it should be directed towards those who have offered little contribution to our life here and have instead spent years siphoning wealth out of one of our proudest institutions,” he wrote.

Anti-racism groups also challenged Ratcliffe on his figures. He said that the UK population had grown to 70 million from 58 million in 2020. But the Office for National Statistics said that the UK population was 67 million in 2020 and was estimated to be 69.5 million in 2025.

“In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it’s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fan base and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants,” the campaign group Kick It Out, which fights racism in soccer, said in a statement. “This type of language and leadership has no place in English football, and we believe most fans will feel the same.”

Ratcliffe, a boyhood fan of United, paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in the club in 2024.

He has faced protests from fans in recent weeks as supporters have criticized the United’s ownership — including the U.S. Glazer family — over the running of the club.

Ratcliffe’s investment saw him assume control of soccer operations after years of decline following the retirement of longtime manager Alex Ferguson in 2013. But he presided over United’s worst-ever Premier League season last year, and instigated swathes of cost-cutting measures, while increasing ticket prices.

Ratcliffe acknowledged that recent decisions had made him unpopular with Manchester United fans. But he said those changes were needed to make the club successful, just as the government must mark tough choices to turn the country around.

“You’ve got all the same issues with the country, don’t you?” he said. “If you want to deal the major issues … then you’re going to have to do some things that are unpopular.”

“I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern,”

That is not even an apology, is like saying "I am sorry that some people feel bad about this, but it is the truth". At the end he didn't even recognized his blunder, much less address the valid criticism about his own actions.

Since when is making inaccurate claims about population, immigration, the number of people on benefits etc a question of 'choice of language'?

The £4 billion pounds in tax which he avoided paying could have made a lot of difference to solving any problems the UK has.

Manchester United, in spite of their recent improvement on the playing field, are a disaster zone in terms of financial management. Lucky he isn't running the country.

Translation.  "I'm not at all sorry for my inaccurate and prejudiced claims. I just wish I'd phrased them differently. "

His numbers may have been  a little off but he spoke the truth. Too many on benefits and too many immigrants. Whether a tax avoider should be the one to say this is a good question.

His numbers may have been a little off but he spoke the truth

Not at all, the numbers are just the most obvious things about what he is lying, the article makes a very good explanation about it.

His numbers may have been a little off but he spoke the truth

The word causing the most trouble was ‘colonized’. A very nasty choice of word.

Having a fair discussion about immigrant numbers and the welfare bill is fine for me, but ‘colonized’ is Tommy Robinson level.

Anyway, perhaps Reform awaits. He’s certainly rich enough to join the likes of Farage and Tice in speaking for the common man.

Pay your taxes.

Starmer’s left-leaning Labour Party won a landslide victory in that election but is now fighting for survival after a series of policy missteps and its failure to prevent thousands of asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel on inflatable boats. The prime minister took to social media late Wednesday to criticize Ratcliffe.

How about focusing and doing something about all those migrant boats Keith?

Sir Jim Ratcliffe issued an apology for offence caused by his comments

Manchester United FC have issued a statement in light of club co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's controversial claim that Britain is being "colonised by immigrants".

The billionaire made the comment in an interview with Sky News, and has since been met with major backlash from politicians, with Sir Keir Starmer calling on him to apologise.

Manchester United have issued a statement on the issues, claiming it "prides itself on being an inclusive and welcoming club."

The statement read: "Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.

"Since launching All Red All Equal in 2016, we have embedded equality, diversity and inclusion into everything we do".

The club pledged to remain "deeply committed" to the principles and spirit of that diversity and equality campaign, reflected in policies and culture.

Over the course of this season, the club has participated in initiatives at both men's and women's games marking mental health, LGBTQ+ inclusion, anti-racism, and more.

"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent," the statement concluded.

"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride."

Prime Minister Sir Kier Starmer condemned Sir Jim's comments, asking the billionaire to issue an apology for the use of the work "colonised", emphasising the benefits of a diverse Britain.

In response, Sir Jim said:  "I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe".

"It is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth".

"My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK.

"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone.

"It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK."

GB News understands the Football Association will examine whether Sir Jim's initial comments "brought the game into disrepute" and breached regulations.

Sir Jim's comments reflected the concern for overpopulation, citing a population increase 12 million, from 58 million in 2020, up to a near 70 million.

Nigel Farage launched a sharp rebuke against Sir Keir Starmer following the Prime Minister's demand for an apology from Sir Jim.

The Reform UK leader accused the Labour government of "turning a blind eye" to the scale of demographic change across the country.

"Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country," Mr Farage declared.

"Labour may try to ignore that but Reform won't."

The People's Channel fan-favourite is less than impressed with the Prime Minister's conduct over the Jim Ratcliffe saga

Nana Akua has taken aim at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe apologised for his public remarks about immigration in Britain.

The Ineos boss claimed Britain has been "colonised by migrants", suggesting the economy was in a dire state due to the number of immigrants on benefits.

The figures and statistics cited by Sir Jim during the interview with Sky News were proven to be incorrect, but it didn't stop his sentiment from being echoed by many public figures.

Former Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne publicly backed the comments, while GB News regulars Michelle Dewberry, Alex Armstrong, and Patrick Christys also came out swinging for Sir Jim.

However, the billionaire was also met by fury from critics, including the prime minister himself, as well as Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, and another Dragons' Den alum, Deborah Meaden.

Less than 24 hours after he made the remarks to Sky, Sir Jim has issued an apology for his "choice of language," and the offence caused to "some people in the UK and Europe".

He added: "But it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.

"My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills, and manufacturing in the UK.

Nana Akua shared her opinion on Sir Keir Starmer's handling of the Jim Ratcliffe saga

"My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry, and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK."

Sir Jim's apology came just hours after it was announced that the Football Association would examine whether the Manchester United co-owner brought the game into disrepute.

If the FA chooses to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour.

One person who is less than happy with the handling of the entire saga, particularly by the Prime Minister, is GB News star Nana, who used X to vent her frustrations.

Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by Nana Akua

Nana fumed after learning of Mr Starmer's calls for Sir Jim to apologise, using the scandals that have engulfed the Labour Party of late as reason to question his judgement.

"Keir Starmer has the nerve to demand Jim Ratcliffe apologise. Why should he?" she pondered.

"He’s not running the country (I’m sure he’d do a better job). Immigration is out of control. How about Starmer focuses his outrage on that instead?"

When Nana faced criticism for her stance, she hit back: "I’m the daughter of immigrants, and I can admit immigration is out of control; that’s the point he’s making. Starmer is just trying to take the focus off himself."

Nana Akua took to social media to hit out at the prime minister

PA

And after Mr Ratcliffe apologised, Nana refused to move the spotlight off the under pressure Labour leader.

"Jim Ratcliffe has apologised.. Can we now focus on Keir Starmer and his bad judgement?" she demanded. "He's not fit to be Prime Minister."

Nana's furious tirade comes at a tumultuous time for the Labour Party, which has been plagued by a series of high-profile scandals, appointments and departures, and U-turns.

Nana's thoughts were echoed by a number of her X followers who were quick to share their thoughts on her social media posts.

"No idea why he apologised. He is 100% correct!!! Probably to shut the woke left up," one X user suggested.

A second claimed: "Starmer apologised and Sir Jim Radcliffe, wrongly, apologised. Starmer will think there's a comparison!!!"

"He should have stood by his words," a third said, while a fourth echoed: "Shouldn’t have apologised, he was correct."

Elsewhere, Nana's fellow People's Channel star Alex Armstrong was similarly angered by Mr Ratcliffe's apology and the pressure put on him by Number 10.

The Alex Armstrong Tonight star penned: "Hundreds of thousands of illegal economic migrants are breaking into our country, some raping children and murdering Brits, yet the PM and establishment unleashed fury over Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s personal thoughts on immigration.

"Disgraceful state of Britain in 2026," he signed off.

Text: Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for "offending some people" with his language after saying the UK had been "colonised by immigrants", but maintained an "open debate" on the matter was needed.

The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United had faced criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, who described his comments on Wednesday as "offensive and wrong".

On Thursday, Sir Jim said: "I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth."

The club has not directly addressed the remarks, but said it "prides itself" on being "inclusive".

"Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home," the club said in a statement on Thursday.

"Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.

"We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride."

Sources told BBC Sport that the FA is examining whether Sir Jim's comments brought the game into disrepute.

Should the FA formally investigate Sir Jim's comments and choose to charge the 73-year-old under its own rules, he could face further punishment.

His earlier comments to Sky News had drawn criticism from Manchester United fan groups. He said: "You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.

"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?"

He incorrectly claimed the population of the UK had risen by 12 million to 70 million people in the last five years. The Office for National Statistics estimates it has actually risen from 66.7 million to 69.4 million, an increase of less than three million.

A Downing Street spokesperson said it was "absolutely right" that Sir Jim had apologised for his language.

Following the billionaire's comments to the broadcaster, the prime minister's spokesman said Sir Keir thought they were "offensive and wrong" and it is "absolutely right" he apologised.

Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said "a lot of people find that language offensive".

He added the government has "done a lot to bear down" on small boats and there is "lots we need to do on irregular migration".

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage previously pushed back against Sir Keir, saying: "Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country."

Following the apology, he told BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast the comments were "accurate and right", if you "take the word colonise out".

"And what Jim is saying is that mass migration has done us harm and made us poorer. And I think he's absolutely right," Farage said.

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Sir Jim's comments "go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood".

"Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region."

Criticism of Sir Jim's remarks also came in from football groups.

Anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out called them "disgraceful and deeply divisive", while anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said it was "deeply concerned".

"Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups," it said in a statement.

"Football clubs and their leadership hold enormous cultural influence."

Ratcliffe, one of Britain's richest individuals, founded one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos.

In 2020, he reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco, which does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.

He acquired a 27.7% stake in Man Utd in 2024, and has since restructured the organisation, making 450 redundancies, overhauling senior management and sacking two managers.

He campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 European Union referendum.

Ahead of the 2024 general election, he told Bloomberg he had "had enough" of the Tories, putting his support instead behind Labour.

The billionaire's comments about the UK being "colonised" by immigrants have divided opinion.

Ineos boss is recognised for the support his company has provided to scientific research.

The work comes after minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke about driving up standards at the club.

One of the UK's richest men, Sir Jim has built a multi-billion pound business by snapping up unloved assets.

One of the world's biggest football clubs is up for sale, but who are the runners and riders to buy it?

Text: Frances had only just arrived at work when she received a phone call that turned her life upside down.

Police officers had arrested her solicitor husband Andrew over allegations he was defrauding clients - and were searching the family home the couple shared with their two children.

Andrew's office, in a leafy village to the south of Manchester, also resembled a scene from a TV drama - cloaked in yellow crime tape, staff in shock and records being boxed up.

His legal practice held power of attorney for many elderly people with dementia. But the police discovered that hundreds of thousands of pounds of Andrew's clients' money were missing. Officers later found he had spent the funds on adult webcam sites, sex workers and antiques.

That was 12 years ago.

A resulting court case would hear Andrew's impulsive behaviour was caused by medication he was being prescribed for Parkinson's disease.

He stole from 13 of his clients. All, except two, were aged over 80, and some were unwell. They had a combined £600,000 taken from their accounts.

One 87-year-old living in a care home died shortly after the theft - her estate didn't have enough money to pay for her funeral.

"People didn't want to know us, and I can understand that entirely," says Frances, thinking back to what Andrew did. While their daughter, Alice, says her father "never forgave himself".

Andrew's behaviour would later have tragic consequences.

His case is extreme - but far from isolated.

Over the past year, we have spoken to scores of families whose lives have been torn apart by impulsive behaviours caused by a family of medications known as dopamine agonist drugs.

These include the development of new sexual urges - such as addictions to pornography and sex workers - but also compulsive shopping and gambling that have cost people tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The drugs are an established treatment for Parkinson's, Restless Legs Syndrome and other conditions. They have been prescribed 1.5 million times by GPs alone in England past year.

NHS advice is clear - if you are taking them and you have any concerns, you should speak to your doctor.

One in six Parkinson's patients on the drugs are affected by impulse control disorders - the clinical term for this behaviour - according to one 2010 study of just over 3,000 people.

In response to our investigation, the chair of the MPs' Health Select Committee has described our findings as "devastating" and has written to the UK drugs regulator asking it to review official warnings.

Many of the people we spoke to told us they had no history of any such impulsive behaviours before taking the drugs - and made no connection with their medication when they began experiencing them.

They say doctors failed either to properly warn them or to monitor the drugs' effects.

Back in the summer of 2013, on the weekend after his arrest, Andrew had attempted to put on a brave face for his family, they say. But that Sunday he collapsed at home and was taken to A&E.

He had been diagnosed with Parkinson's a few years before and, when he began to experience shakes, doctors had prescribed a drug called Pramipexole. The medicine's effects were "miraculous", according to Frances.

Pramipexole and similar drugs work by boosting the activity of dopamine - a chemical that helps regulate our movements, but which also drives feelings of reward and enjoyment.

Andrew's Parkinson's tremor dramatically reduced, say his family, and soon he was even back playing tennis.

But in A&E after his collapse, a doctor asked Frances if she was aware that Pramipexole could cause a range of impulsive behaviours in people who take it.

Frances says this was a "terrible shock". She couldn't understand why she had never been warned despite attending all of Andrew's appointments.

The potential side effects of the medication, she says, finally explained Andrew's compulsive shopping - although at that point she had no idea about the true extent of his spending.

Before his diagnosis, Andrew had used webcams and sex-chat sites roughly once a week. But in the year after he started on the pills, he made nearly 500 payments to them.

He went on to spend more than £100,000 on one website alone using his clients' money. He also spent nearly £80,000 on sex workers in just four months, and when he was arrested his mobile phone was found to contain the numbers of 90 different escorts.

Andrew - who had always been a big history buff - also began compulsively buying antique pens, pottery and cricket memorabilia. He spent £85,000 on eBay in the six months leading up to the police raid.

"Dad was so ashamed from the point he was arrested, he basically didn't leave the house," says Alice.

For more than a year, the family waited to hear from prosecutors - in the end, Andrew was charged with fraud.

Frances says the couple's son, Harry, "loved his dad very much" - but that Harry, who had longstanding mental health problems, found what happened after his father's arrest "very difficult to cope with".

Harry's mental health became so bad that he was sectioned. He returned home, then disappeared. Weeks later his body was discovered - he had taken his own life.

In court in 2015, Andrew pleaded guilty. During sentencing the judge said he had squandered his clients' money on various "sexual excesses" and "absurd extravagances".

Mr Justice Openshaw said he believed Andrew's behaviour had been caused by the drugs he was taking - but argued he had been a practising solicitor who was still able to competently conduct his business in other ways.

As a man with family, friends and advisers - said the judge - Andrew should have sought help from them and identified the effect the medication was having on him.

Andrew was sentenced to four years inside HM Prison Manchester, commonly known as Strangeways.

During the investigation, all Andrew's assets were frozen to recoup some of the money stolen from his clients.

The family were also unable to proceed with a clinical negligence case against Andrew's doctors because legal rules can bar the recovery of damages closely connected to a serious criminal act.

Frances and Andrew got divorced while he was in prison. Upon his release, two years after being jailed, he moved into sheltered accommodation.

Prison had taken its toll on Andrew, say his family, and the Covid lockdowns were particularly hard on him. He had stopped taking the dopamine agonist medication immediately after discovering its effect on him and his Parkinson's symptoms had advanced.

"I think his whole life got completely dismantled," says Alice. "Yes, because of the Parkinson's, but really because of the drugs."

In October 2020, Andrew killed himself.

His death is not listed in the UK's Yellow Card public record - the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) scheme that collates reported adverse effects of drugs. Neither will it include that of his son, Harry.

The collateral harm caused by dopamine agonist drugs to wider families will also not be recorded. Some told us they had lost their life savings or even their homes to users' compulsive gambling, shopping or other behaviours.

Many also said they had been left with no recourse to justice for their losses because of the challenges of mounting class actions in the UK, and the difficulties in fulfilling the requirements of a clinical negligence case, where they would have to prove they had not been warned.

It has been more than 20 years since these dopamine agonist drugs were first found to cause impulsive behaviour.

Last year, the BBC revealed how GSK - the British drugs firm that first licensed this type of drug for Parkinson's in the UK - had discovered, as far back as 2003, a link between its medication and what it called "deviant" sexual behaviour.

Warnings appeared three years later but only listed the potential for an "increased libido", "harmful behaviour" and an "altered sexual interest". These patient information leaflets still do not state how common impulse control disorders can be.

Now Layla Moran, who chairs the MPs' Health Select Committee, is calling for warnings to list how common impulse control disorders are as a whole and state the specific types of behaviours - such as porn addiction - sometimes developed.

"It's not just a side effect that affects an individual, it's affecting families and communities and creating new victims," she told us.

"What does 'impulsive behaviour' mean and how likely is it that they [patients] can get it? At the moment, patients don't have that information, and without it, how can they be expected to mitigate it?"

Ms Moran says the MHRA's Yellow Card scheme is "not fit for purpose" for reporting side effects people find shameful.

The government has also described our findings are "hugely concerning".

However, the MHRA told us there are no plans to change warnings. These sexual behaviours are "individualised", says the agency, and so it is not possible to include an "exhaustive list" in information leaflets.

It previously told the BBC it does not list the frequency of impulse control disorders because many people do not report them.

GSK said its drug had been extensively trialled, repeatedly approved by regulators around the world and prescribed for more than 17 million treatments. It said it had shared its report about safety concerns with regulators.

Solicitor Andrew's prescribed drug, Pramipexole, is made by Boehringer Ingelheim. The company did not comment.

In 2017, doctors were required to give Parkinson's patients, and their families verbal and written information about the risk of impulsive behaviours, and to regularly monitor their development - under guidelines from NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

But the BBC has heard from many Parkinson's patients prescribed the drugs since those guidelines were introduced, who say they were not properly warned about the risks. Some patients say they are currently suffering from impulsive behaviours.

Alice and Frances have moved hundreds of miles away from the village they lived in, but their pain remains with them.

"I had my life taken away from me: my home, the community I lived in, but above all my son," says Frances.

"I just don't have the words to say how devastating that is."

UK to cooperate on extradition

Britain has offered its cooperation to India in the extradition of terrorists as part of its resolve to ensure that this country does not become a safe haven for those who have committed offences of violence in India. British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd coupled the offer with a warning to those who have settled in Britain not to disturb peace, “in pursuit of quarrels which have nothing to do with this country”. The warning follows attacks on moderate Sikh leaders in Britain from extremists.

Cold wave intensifies

Renewed spells of scattered to widespread snowfall in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir and isolated rains in the plains during the past 24 hours intensified the cold wave conditions in most of northern India. Dense fogs and mists, which reduced the visibility to between nil and 500 metres, disrupted normal schedule of air, train and bus services.

Oswal Group raided

The Enforcement Directorate conducted day-long raids on the premises of Oswal Group of companies in Bombay in connection with alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. According to reliable sources, the raids revealed that the company had exported diamonds through local dealer Ketan Diamonds to the United Kingdom in 1983, the proceeds of which, worth about $3 lakh, were still outstanding.

Text: Reform UK is replacing the "old, fuddy-duddy" Conservative party, leader Nigel Farage has told the BBC.

Senior Conservatives including sitting MPs Suella Braverman, Robert Jenrick and Danny Kruger, as well as former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, have defected to Reform in recent months.

Farage now has more of former prime minister Liz Truss's cabinet in his party than Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has in her current shadow cabinet.

But when asked by the BBC's Nick Robinson on Radio 4's Political Thinking if this meant Reform was morphing into the latest version of the Conservatives, Farage said it was "no surprise" MPs were choosing to jump ship.

Predicting that May's Scottish, Welsh and English council elections would bring a collapse in support for the two biggest parties in British politics, Farage said the Tories were finished as a national party.

"We've replaced the old fuddy-duddy existing Conservative Party with a new force on the centre-right, that's got a bit more energy, a bit more enthusiasm, a little bit more fire," he said.

When Jenrick jumped ship in mid-January, Farage had also promised a mysterious Labour defection was imminent.

One month on, he was asked whether he was still expecting a Labour figure to join Reform and responded: "There are going to be several."

He added: "I haven't got a magic wand. Things don't always happen immediately, but it will happen."

The next electoral test will be the Gorton and Denton by-election in Greater Manchester on Thursday 26 February, with Farage hoping his candidate Matthew Goodwin could win the party's ninth parliamentary seat.

Robinson highlighted how Goodwin had said some UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds were not always British and being British "takes more than a piece of paper" on the campaign trail.

Asked how he would define Britishness, Farage said the test for "our own people" was whether people "instinctively" confirm their identity.

"You've got to instinctively respond 'I'm British' to be part of it," he said. "If you're not responding 'I'm British', you're not part of it."

He added: "It's about your priorities -- what is the thing that you really believe you're part of... Nationality really is an extension of being part of the family."

This did not exclude non-white people,  Farage said, claiming Reform won more votes from the Black, Asian and minority Ethnic community than the Liberal Democrats in the 2024 general election.

Instead, he pointed to a "Marxist... poisoning of the minds", having previously criticised schools and universities for teaching "twisted interpretations" of British history.

"I think the concern and the worry is there are a lot of people here who have been brought up to actually loathe the country," he said.

Farage also voiced support for Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who on Wednesday said the UK had been "colonised by immigrants".

Sir Jim apologised for "offending some people" with his language after the prime minister described his comments as "offensive and wrong", although he maintained an "open debate" on the matter was needed.

Farage told Political Thinking his comments were "accurate and right", if you "take the word colonise out".

The Reform leader described east London, where there are signs in foreign languages, as an example of where "large parts of our country have become unrecognisable", adding: "What Jim is saying is that mass migration has done us harm and made us poorer and I think he is absolutely right."

A Labour spokesperson said a "staggering" 26 former Conservative MPs and "countless" former Tory councillors had joined Reform.

"How do we know that Reform would decimate public services and make people poorer?" they added. "Because it's full of the same old failed Tories that did it all before. You simply can't trust them."

The BBC has contacted the Conservatives for comment.

The spat soon spiralled out of control after the Reform MP complained the GB News Political Editor was 'nitpicking' at the facts

Watch the moment Richard Tice and GB News's Political Editor Christopher Hope began squabbling over Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent comments on migration.

Last night, Sir Keir Starmer condemned the claim Britain was "colonised by immigrants", branding it as "offensive and wrong". He further called on the Manchester United co-owner to apologise.

Sir Jim has since apologised for the comments, saying: "I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe."

But earlier today, Mr Tice's boss Nigel Farage backed the co-owner of Manchester United's claim, despite the comment igniting intense backlash.

On GB News, the Reform MP said: "He said two key things. He said that the population had grown from 58 million to 70 million. He's bang on the money.

"He also said that we couldn't afford large scale, uncontrolled immigration, if people are not working, when you've got nine million people - give or take - out of work on benefits. On those two things, he's absolutely right."

Immediately, Christopher interjected: "He wasn't. It was wrong, wasn't it?"

"No, that's completely wrong," Mr Tice stated, but Christopher maintained the timescale Sir Jim set out was wrong.

While making the statement, Sir Jim said the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it is 70 million, jumping up 12 million people during that period.

The spat soon spiralled out of control after Richard Tice complained Christopher Hope was 'nitpicking' at the facts

GB NEWS

However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated the UK population was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024.

The population was estimated to sit at 58.9 million in 2000.

Nevertheless, the Boston & Skegness MP maintained "everyone knew what he was trying to say".

He continued: "In the last 20 or so years, the population has increased from 58 to 70 million people, the vast majority of which is external immigration into the country with no democratic mandate from the British people.

Christopher Hope was left incredulous from the interaction

GB NEWS

"And we can't afford millions and millions of people on out of work benefits. We need to get people back into work. Now, some people have been offended by the use of the word 'colonise'.

"Frankly, the people who should be apologising is the Westminster elite that whenever someone uses a slightly dirty word, they try and smear them and label them and shut down debate. And that's what this Prime Minister utterly, disgracefully did.

"The same Prime Minister, by the way, said that we risked becoming an island of strangers."

But Christopher argued Prime Minister, after the fact, admitted he regretted calling Britain an island of strangers, which caused subsequent uproar.

"He said if he held that speech up to the light, he wouldn't have said it," Christopher added.

"You know jolly well that Jim Ratcliffe says in 2020, 12 million more people have come here since 2000."

But immediately Mr Tice fumed: "That is pathetic. That is the Westminster literati!"

"It's the truth," an incredulous Christopher said.

"Chris! People in the pub talk about the fact that the population has dramatically increased. It is, you know, people do misspeak on the media when they're not used to speaking much in the media.

"And of course, he meant in the year 2000 when that's what the population. And for you to nitpick around that...""

"It's the facts! It's not nitpicking," the GB News presenter hit back in astonishment when Mr Tice said he was being "juvenile".

"It's not juvenile! You're being ridiculous. You're not accepting what you said. The facts are wrong. He needs to correct the record," Christopher declared.

Still, Mr Tice was dissatisfied with their row, urging Christopher to "get out of the Westminster bubble and go and talk to real people".

He said: "Occasionally, real people will use the word colonise because in a sense, they're just telling it as they see it."

Speaking to GB News, a resident called for urgent action to bring jobs back, rebuild local industry, and restore purpose and pride to their towns

Patrick Christys has been in East Durham talking to locals about the challenges facing the North East and what needs to be done to revive the region.

Once the heart of industry, many communities now face "unemployment, brain drain, and the social impacts of deindustrialisation".

Speaking to GB News, a resident called for urgent action to bring jobs back, rebuild local industry, and restore purpose and pride to their towns.

Pip Fallow, who wrote a book called Dragged Up Proper told The People's Channel: "Employment is the biggest issue facing this area. one hundred per cent.

"It’s the lack of industry. We’ve got a ready workforce people trained through local colleges, with skills from the industrial days.

"But right now, there just aren’t enough jobs. On our campaign to try and bring industry back, we estimate about 156 people are chasing every engineering role coming out of college.

"We’ve got the workforce, but we don’t have the industry to support them. And what that does to people’s lives? They leave.

"We’re seeing a brain drain. People want better lives for their children than they had, but they can’t provide that here anymore."

Patrick Christys speaks to locals about how to restore 'the beating heart' of the North-East

GB NEWS

When asked what “re-industrialise” would look like in practice, Mr Fallows explained: “Like it used to look, if you read my book which is about my life, it's a sort of memoir.

"I've gone from 40 years ago when we had a really happy community and where everybody had fulfillment and enjoyed working, and everybody had purpose in their lives.

"We've ended up in a situation where that just isn't the case, we've got a lot of drug problems, substance abuse and alcoholism.

"A lot of my friends. I'm 60 this year, but a lot of my friends haven't got this far. And a lot of them died in the 30s because of deindustrialisation.

Patrick Christys spoke to locals in East Durham

GB NEWS

"People always say, 'oh, what about the environment if you're really industrialised?' I said, what about my environment?

"We need a government here, and we've never, ever been able to tick at the ballot box and have a government that would industrialise.

"We can chase Thatcher back and say, 'oh, she shut the pits'.  That's a fact. We know all that, we've got the data in on that.

"The Labour Party were quite sympathetic in certain cases; locally, they would come and say, 'our Labour Party is against this pit closure' and everything.

"But we've never had anybody who stood up until now and said, 'look, let's, you know, pick for us at the ballot box and we'll re-industrialise let the people around here make things'. That's what they're good at."

For 74 years, the seat of Easington in East Durham has been a fortress for the Labour Party.

However it seems that the Red Wall heartland is on the verge of a seismic shift, with locals predicting a "95 per cent chance" of the seat flipping to Reform UK.

Last year, Reform secured a landslide victory in May, winning 65 seats across County Durham and taking control of the county council.

Louise Penders was elected on to Durham County Council as representative for Easington and Shotton in a by-election increasing the party's majority. The by-election had been called when former Reform councillor John Bailey stepped down in June.

The businesswoman and investor has publicly condemned the remarks made by the Manchester United co-owner

Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden has come out swinging against Sir Jim Ratcliffe after the billionaire businessman claimed the UK had been "colonised by immigrants".

The Ineos boss caused quite the political debate on Wednesday when he publicly claimed that immigration was ruining Britain's economy.

"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in," Sir Jim said.


Speaking to Sky, Sir Jim used figures to back up his claims. "I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people," he said.

However, it should be noted that according to the Office for National Statistics, the estimate for the UK's population in mid-2025 was 69.4 million, compared with 66.7 million in mid-2020.

Since Sky published his remarks, Sir Jim has come under pressure to apologise for his comments, most notably from the prime minister.

Sir Keir Starmer branded Mr Ratcliffe's statement as "wrong and offensive". Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey has also called on the billionaire to say sorry.

However, among those publicly backing the Manchester United co-owner was fellow business tycoon Duncan Bannatyne.

On X, the former Dragons' Den star endorsed Mr Ratcliffe's claims. In the first of several posts showing his support, Mr Bannatyne was reacting to a post by columnist Kelvin MacKenzie.

Mr MacKenzie urged his followers to "listen" to Mr Ratcliffe. "Certainly in some parts of the country the density of migrants makes you wonder if you are still in Britain," Mr MacKenzie alleged.

"You can be sure critics (Gary Neville will be quick out of the trap) will focus on the fact he now lives as a tax exile Monaco. Let me point out he and his company have paid more tax to our exchequer over the years than all his critics put together," Mr MacKenzie stated.

Deborah Meaden publicly opposed the comments made by Sir Jim

Mr Bannatyne echoed Mr MacKenzie's support of Sir Jim, reposting the statement with a simple caption: "Here here."

"The more millionaires and billionaires that speak out, the stronger our voice becomes," a separate X user replied, to which Mr Bannatyne concurred: "Agreed."

Mr Bannatyne faced criticism for his endorsement of Mr Ratcliffe. Hitting back at one complaint, Mr Bannatyne said: "You think all the male fighting class immigrants arriving by boats now are paying for their own accommodation & food & medical bills & legal representation?"

He defended Sir Jim further against critics. "There is a difference to moving to Monaco & paying into the system and arriving in uk in a small dingy penniless," he penned. (sic)

No but neither are migrants.

Ms Meaden waded into the debate, and while she didn't address her former co-star's stance directly, she made her feelings on the issue crystal clear.

In one of her own posts, Ms Meaden fired back at Rupert Lowe MP after he took to X to back Mr Ratcliffe and declared his claims as "right".

The Dragons' Den investor offered an opposing view. "Except on the actual facts… like the actual numbers," she sarcastically sniped.

The businesswoman was also questioned on whether she felt Sir Jim was "a net financial drain" on Monaco. "No but neither are migrants," Ms Meaden hit back.

Ms Meaden wasn't done there as she reposted a series of social media updates condemning Mr Ratcliffe.

In one post reposted by the Meaden, an X user said: "A 'Sir' worth £30,000,000,000 and who moved his residency to Monaco to avoid tax....calls out immigrants as the problem.

"This man is the manifestation of all that's wrong with society, not the poor person seeking a better life."

Ms Meaden also reposted another post that read: "This asset stripper lives in Monaco & pays no income tax in the UK, but feels entitled to opine on how OUR taxes are spent, while badmouthing immigrants as ‘invaders’ & benefit leeches. (sic)

Deborah Meaden has backed the PM's called for Sir Jim to apologise

PA

"This is the same guy who expects the government to cough up OUR taxes to rebuild Old Trafford."

She seemingly endorsed another post from an X user that slammed the Manchester United co-owner.

The X user had penned: "The idea that the co-owner of a football club - once hailed for its socialist roots - could spew such rhetoric against immigrants, the vast majority of whom are here to earn a living, is mind-blowing. Let's hear from you, Manchester United legends."

The Dragons' Den star also reposted social media updates from Sir Keir and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed that called for Mr Ratcliffe to apologise.

Cheers went up in the room after the ex-miner lauded Nigel Farage's party

A retired Durham miner has hailed his Reform-led council as a reason to be optimistic in a former Labour heartland today.

Speaking to Patrick Christys in the north west, Dr Brian Brown opened up about the levels of deprivation and disadvantage which has impacted his local community but hailed his turquoise-tinted council.

Nigel Farage's party took control of Durham County Council after snatching more than half of the seats from both Labour and the Tories, bringing Reform's total to 65 councillors in the ex-Labour heartland.

"This has been Labour stronghold for decades now," he told Patrick. "Yet sadly, there is so such high levels of deprivation and disadvantage in our communities that has also gone on for decades.

"I mean, we have something like 42,500 households across this area, and yet only 38 per cent of those households actually live without some form of deprivation.

"So how can Labour, after all these decades, explain that?

"There's only about 50 per cent of the population actually in employment. Some 32 per cent in higher paid employment.

"There is such low aspiration in this area," he added. But Dr Brown admitted he had some "room for optimism" when his county council turned turquoise last May.

As soon as he mentioned Reform UK, hearty cheers went up across the room.

"On the back of that one of the towns, Seaham Harbour, for the first time, in over a hundred years does not have any Labour councillors either in the town or at the county council," the ex-miner added.

"I'm encouraged because last month the leadership adopted a motion and adopted a policy for re-industrialisation of the county. Now that is a massive plus.

"And I also know that they are in discussions and negotiations with some big companies, and I think that East Durham will totally benefit from that."

Last week, council leaders pledged to reindustrialise County Durham, scrapping the region's net zero ambitions

Reform beckoned the council to "reverse Durham's decline" and improve the county's economic opportunities by reviving the industrial heartland.

Cllr Kyle Genner said: "The towns and villages of Durham were built on industry, and that industry was built using cheap, abundant, reliable energy.

"Those things were taken away and our industrial communities had their beating hearts torn out. We know what made Durham great, and we know what led to Durham’s decline."

Zia Yusuf alongside party leader Nigel Farage

Mr Farage has previously said the UK should produce its own gas, oil and steel in a pledge to "reindustrialise".

He and his party,  including policy frontman Zia Yusuf, have regularly hit out at net zero. Instead, they urge Britain to become an "energy exporter".

Speaking at the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (Arc) conference in London last year, he said: "We take the view that if we’re going to be using gas, if we’re going to be using oil in this country from 2050... we may as well produce them ourselves in our own country.

"Our platform is to reindustrialise Britain. We closed down the steel industry. We think closing down the steel industry is good because it means our national CO2 output is down.

"All that happens is the plant closes in Redcar, the plant closes in South Wales. It reopens in India under lower environmental standards, and then the steel is shipped back to us.

"So let's produce all the stuff we need in this country. Let’s become not just energy independent – we could actually become an energy exporter right now."

Nodding, Patrick told Dr Brown: "You are quite literally sitting on a goldmine here, aren't you in this area?

"You've got natural resources both under your feet and offshore as well. And apparently you're not allowed to tap into any of those, which seems absolutely remarkable, doesn't it?"

The former home secretary, who left the Conservatives last month, sat down with Choppers' Political Podcast

Suella Braverman has told GB News she would be happy if Nigel Farage pursued socialist policies if he were prime minister.

The former home secretary, who is one of the most senior former Conservative defectors to Reform UK, said she supports the state nationalising failing British industries.

Mrs Braverman also revealed she has yet to receive a personal apology from Kemi Badenoch after the Tories wrongly suggested she had mental health issues before defecting to Mr Farage's party.

She spoke to the People's Channel as Mr Farage looks set to announce his shadow cabinet to "get the party into shape" in preparation for a general election.

Reform UK has been criticised by those on the right for backing left-wing policies, such as nationalising parts of the UK steel industry and lifting the two-child benefit cap.

However, Mrs Braverman told GB News' Chopper's Political Podcast she was not troubled by these policies.

Asked if she was "happy" if her party pursued "socialist" policies, Mrs Braverman said: "I am actually.

"So I think there's actually a case for — if we are serious about industrialising our country and a renaissance of our industry — state involvement in our industries.

"Our heavy industries have been abandoned and unable to compete against a more powerful and ascendant East.

"And so I do think there is a very strong case.

"The benefit will be more jobs.

"The benefit will be more growth for our economy.

The former minister defected to Reform UK last month

"And I do think that radical thinking needs to be put in place."

The Tories came under fire for saying Mrs Braverman had mental health issues when she quit the party a few weeks ago.

The party later withdrew the remark.

However, Mrs Braverman disclosed she had not had a personal apology from Tory leader Ms Badenoch, saying: "They haven't actually apologised to me directly.

"The leader has said she's apologised, but no one has apologised."

"There's been no apology directly to me, despite their saying there's been an apology.

"And that is what the Conservative Party is today."

She added: "It says more about them than it does about me."

Mrs Braverman was dismissive of Mrs Badenoch's commitment to taking the UK out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if the Tories win the next election.

She said: "I don't believe they will.

"There's more chance of me joining Zack Polanski's Green Party."

Text: The left-wing Labour government in Britain is facing accusations of seeking to cover up what is going on inside the criminal justice system by deleting one of the largest court records archives.

The Ministry of Justice has ordered Courstdesk to delete its court records archive, which journalists and media organisations have used to inform the public about crimes in their communities.

The organisation said it has been used by over 1,500 journalists from 39 media organisations since it was created in 2021 under the previous Conservative government, in a bid to “improve coverage of the courts by the news media”.

Courtsdesk said it had discovered the media was not informed about hearings for two thirds of all standard cases, and that merely 4.2 per cent of court cases were listed accurately, meaning journalists were not able to inform the public about criminal cases in the vast majority of instances.

Chief executive for the firm, Enda Leahy, told The Times of London: “We built the only system that could tell journalists what was actually happening in the criminal courts.

“We wrote 16 times asking for dialogue. Last week we got our answer: delete everything. If the government were interested in open justice, they would engage in a dialogue.”

Shadow Home Secretary for the Conservative Party Chris Philp, who was behind the government efforts to establishment, described the decision to delete the archive as a “cover up”.

“These courts records contain data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants & data on the rape gang scandal. Yet the government wants to delete it all. They have learnt nothing,” he said.

Others also raised the issue of transparency surrounding crims such as the mass rape of English girls by predominantly Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs.

Conservative MP Katie Lam said: “To know the truth about the grooming gangs, we must have access to court records, at every level. The culture of secrecy in many of our institutions helped cover up these crimes in the first place.

“Labour must not be allowed to do this. The public deserves to know the truth.”

Adam Wren, the director of the Open Justice UK group, which advocates for greater transparency in the legal system, said that “court reporting is dead” in Britain with the move.

He said that previously newspapers had dedicated court reporters who built up relations within the judicial system, but now they have mostly retired and have not been replaced as media budgets have waned. Therefore, he said that most crime reporters have become dependent on listings through firms such as Courtdesk, but “the government is killing that too.”

The move comes in the wake of the Labour government rolling out plans to remove the right to a jury trial in most cases excepting the most serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape, and terrorism, in favour of justice handed out by a single judge.

Critics have warned that removing the ability to appeal to ones peers will enable the government to impose more authoritarianism on the public, particularly in areas such as free speech, with over 12,000 already being arrested every year for comments made online.

Commenting on the latest development, frequent critic of the British government and the owner of the X social media platform, Elon Musk remarked: “The UK has become Orwell’s worst nightmare.”

Nigel Farage has backed Sir Jim Ratcliffe's claim that Britain is colonised by immigrants - despite the comment igniting intense backlash.

Last night, Sir Keir Starmer condemned the claim, branding the words "offensive and wrong" and calling on the Manchester United co-owner to apologise.

But, today, the Reform UK leader said "Jim Ratcliffe is right" and that parts of Britain have changed.

He said: "You look at parts of London, for example, where the road names, the underground signs aren't just in English, they're in a foreign language as well.

"One million people living in this country don't speak any English at all.

"Four million people living in this country barely speak passable English.

"And that's the point that he was making, that big areas of our towns and cities have been changed into something completely different to what they were."

In a statement, Sir Jim apologised for his "choice of language offended some people", adding: "It is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth."

Ben Goldsmith urged Reform UK to make 'the patriotic case for nature'

Reform UK has distanced itself from former Boris Johnson ally and Conservative environmentalist Ben Goldsmith after farmers objected to his rewilding advocacy.

Nigel Farage is understood to have abandoned plans for him to develop the party's environmental strategy ahead of the next general election, weeks after the two discussed policy proposals.

Deputy leader Richard Tice dismissed any prospect of collaboration with Mr Goldsmith, declaring: "Farmers can trust Reform."

The party has pledged to instead consult "experienced farmers, land managers, and industry experts" when shaping its countryside policies.

Mr Goldsmith, a financier and wildlife campaigner, co-founded the Conservative Environment Network in 2010.

The brother of Tory peer Lord Goldsmith, he served as an adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2018 to 2022.

Mr Farage and Reform UK policy adviser James Orr had enlisted him to work on issues such as fishing rights and green belt protection.

He submitted a detailed document to the Reform leader, in which he urged Mr Farage to make "the patriotic case for nature", framing conservation as central to British heritage and national identity.

The recommendations included removing foreign fishing vessels from UK waters, championing native species reintroduction, and increasing penalties for fly-tipping.

However, the National Gamekeepers Organisation reportedly raised concerns about Goldsmith's involvement in shaping Reform's rural agenda.

Critics argue that rewilding removes agricultural land from production by allowing it to return to a wild state.

Mr Goldsmith has rewilded his own Somerset farm and built a reputation as a prominent advocate for the practice.

Nigel Farage is understood to have made the call over complaints from farmers

While supporters say rewilding benefits wildlife, opponents contend it undermines food production.

Reform had initially hoped Mr Goldsmith's environmental credentials would help attract green-minded Conservative voters.

Internal research showed 80 per cent of Reform supporters care deeply about nature, while polling indicated environmentally conscious Tories remained reluctant to back Mr Farage's party.

Welsh sheep farmer Gareth Wyn Jones welcomed the decision, stating: "It was time Goldsmith was taken out of the equation. He doesn't represent the average family farmer."

Farmers raised concerns over Mr Goldsmith's rewilding plans

Mr Jones added: "Goldsmith was definitely not the guy to be giving Reform any advice."

Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, emphasised that rural areas would prove crucial at the next election.

He warned that parties seeking to restore trust with countryside communities must recognise that rural Britain is "a full-time place of work, not a laboratory".

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Bonner cautioned ignoring farmers would fail to improve biodiversity or resolve food production challenges.

Supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party chanting slogans as they celebrate unofficial news of Mr Tarique Rahman's win in his constituency, on Feb 12 in Dhaka.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 05:59 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 06:05 AM

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landmark parliamentary election on Feb 13, a local TV station showed, as ballots were counted in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the troubled South Asian country.

BNP won 151 seats in the 300-member “Jatiya Sangsad”, or House of the Nation, Ekattor TV showed, crossing the halfway mark for a simple majority.

Its main rival, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, had 42 seats. Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman indicated the party was conceding even before BNP touched the halfway number.

Votes were cast on Feb 11 and tens of millions of Bangladeshis turned up for what was the first election since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time prime minister Sheikh Hasina.


Just weeks after a dramatic purge of China’s top general, the CIA is moving to capitalise on any resulting discord with a new public video targeting potential informants in the Chinese military.

The US spy agency on Feb 12 rolled out the video depicting a disillusioned mid-level Chinese military officer, in the latest US step in a campaign to ramp up human intelligence gathering on Washington’s strategic rival.

It follows a similar effort in May 2025 that focused on fictional figures within China’s ruling Communist Party that provided detailed Chinese-language instructions on how to securely contact US intelligence.

A UK child-care worker who filmed himself sexually abusing youngsters at a nursery where he worked and downloaded over 26,000 indecent images of children was jailed for 18 years on Feb 12.

Vincent Chan, 45, who admitted a raft of 56 charges including sexual assault, was described in court as “every parent’s worst nightmare”.

Passing sentence, Judge John Dodd told him he was guilty of an “utterly wicked, perverse and depraved” campaign of sexual abuse.



Ukraine blamed a Russian disinformation campaign on Feb 12 after fake news posted online about its Winter Olympics team, including a story criticising an athlete disqualified for trying to highlight war deaths.

The fake posts, which racked up over a million views across multiple platforms, included a claim about Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, banned from competing on Feb 12 for wearing a helmet with images of athletes killed in the war.

“Russians have rolled out an information campaign to discredit Ukraine,” Kyiv’s Centre for Countering Disinformation said on Feb 12.



Four-time world champion Max Verstappen launched a scathing broadside at the new breed of Formula One cars, describing them as “anti-racing” at the end of the second day of testing in Bahrain on Feb 12.

The Dutchman ran his Red Bull for 136 laps on Feb 11, clocking the second quickest time of the day, before watching new teammate Isack Hadjar take to the track on Feb 12.

But speaking at his first press conference of the year, Verstappen was underwhelmed by this year’s rule changes which have led to a complete overhaul of chassis and engines for every team, with a bigger focus on energy management.

Text: LONDON, February 12. /TASS/. As part of its next 500 million pound sterling ($682 million) military aid package for Ukraine, Great Britain will allot 150 million pounds ($205 million) towards buying US weaponry under the PURL program, the UK Ministry of Defense reported.

"The Defence Secretary will confirm that the UK will for the first time provide 150 million to the NATO Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, which ensures the rapid delivery of air defence interceptors to defend Ukraine’s skies," the ministry clarified in a statement.

An additional 390 million pounds ($532 million) will be allocated for the supply of an extra 1,000 Light Multirole Missiles (LMM) produced in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The UK Ministry of Defense also promised to deliver 1,200 anti-aircraft missiles and 200,000 artillery shells to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the coming months.

On February 12, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced that London would allocate half a billion pounds for purchases under the PURL scheme. Rutte later clarified that this 500 million pounds is intended for the procurement of air defense systems both from the United States and on a bilateral basis.

The PURL program was established by NATO last summer following the US decision to stop providing free weapons to Kiev. Under the program, Ukraine defines its military needs, EU countries allocate funds, purchase weapons from the US, and transfer them to Ukraine free of charge.

Text: Parents should be involved in the "vast majority" of cases where a child questions their gender, according to new government guidance for all English schools.

The legally-binding advice says schools should not initiate steps towards social transitioning - when pupils change their name, pronoun or clothes to reflect their gender identity - and should instead consider carefully what other support a child might need.

In primary schools in particular, full social transitioning should only happen "very rarely", it says.

The guidance has been backed by the author of the landmark Cass Review, Dr Hilary Cass, who said the guidance was "a huge step in the right direction".

Her review of gender care services for under-18s, published in 2024, was commissioned by NHS England after it saw a sharp rise in referrals for patients questioning their gender.

Her report said the evidence around medical interventions in gender care was "remarkably weak", and there was a lack of research available.

The guidance also says there are "no exceptions" for single-sex facilities at schools and colleges, including toilets and changing rooms, with single-sex sports also protected.

But schools have been given some flexibility over how they deal with issues such as children's names and uniforms.

The BBC understands single-sex schools will continue to follow the current admissions code, which allows them to admit pupils only on the basis of their biological sex.

Cass said the guidance was "practical and reflects the recommendations of my review, giving schools much-needed clarity on their legal duties so they can support children with confidence".

Overall, the new guidance also makes a clear distinction between a child's wishes, and what might be in their best interests.

There is a reminder that while some children explore different gender identities, most do not go on as adults to fully transition to a different gender from their biological sex.

"What comes across quite strongly in the guidance is that proceeding with a social transition is going to be very much the exception, rather than the rule," Cass told the BBC.

She emphasised the importance of involving parents wherever possible, saying "children don't thrive well when there are secrets between them and their parents".

"Too many times during my review I heard about schools having socially transitioned young people without involving parents, and parents were in possession of all sorts of knowledge about what's going on that the school just wouldn't know about," she said.

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the new guidance would deliver "pragmatic support for teachers, reassurance for parents, and above all, the safety and wellbeing of children and young people".

Maya Forstater, CEO of Sex Matters, welcomed the news of the guidance, but criticised its content around social transition.

"Schools are still being left with the idea that they can facilitate 'social transition' – which remains undefined – and that they should negotiate this on a case-by-case basis," she said.

"They are being encouraged to think that children have a 'birth sex' as well as some other concept of sex. This has no basis in law or reality, and undermines safeguarding."

A spokesperson for the charity Stonewall said it would be reviewing the guidance carefully, and the final statutory guidance should listen to and reflect the experiences of young people who are questioning their gender.

"Many in the LGBTQ+ community, especially trans people, are increasingly feeling their voices are not heard," they added.

The new advice around children questioning their gender has been included in an update to existing statutory guidance for schools on how to keep children safe.

It was first promised in 2018 in England.

The long delay has left head teachers navigating one of the most contested social issues on their own.

Some have paid for legal advice, while others have taken mitigating steps such as introducing gender-neutral toilets.

Schools have been reacting to the news.

Tomas Thurogood-Hyde, director of corporate services at Astrea Academy Trust, said: "The language on single-sex spaces and the avoidance of schools acting alone is clear.

"This should give parents confidence in there being a more uniform approach across England, rather than a postcode lottery."

Heather Fowler, head of safeguarding at Endeavour Learning Trust, said: "The safety and wellbeing of every child have always been, and will always remain, at the heart of our work. This updated guidance does not change our approach.

"We have consistently worked in partnership with families to ensure decisions are made carefully, thoughtfully and in the best interests of each individual child."

Thursday's update has been roundly welcomed by head teachers' unions.

Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools had done a "very good job" dealing with the issue during an "often-polarised public debate" in recent years.

Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the guidance would address the need for "greater clarity about how schools should manage this sensitive issue and support their pupils".

In December 2023, the previous Conservative government had published draft guidance for consultation, which took a harder stance on some issues, including banning the use of alternate pronouns in primary school.

But that consultation was overtaken by the calling of a general election in May 2024, which ultimately led to a change of government.

A new consultation on Thursday's updated guidance is due to run for 10 weeks.

Devolved governments across the rest of the UK have previously provided their own gender guidance for schools, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex in 2025.

In Scotland, ministers said facilities must be available on the basis of biological sex, but schools could also provide gender-neutral toilets.

In Northern Ireland, guidance on supporting transgender pupils was withdrawn from the Education Authority's website in September 2025.

Education Minister Paul Givan had said he had asked officials to consider the implications of the Supreme Court decision and to seek legal advice.

In Wales, schools were told in 2023 to expect guidance on supporting transgender pupils the next academic year. An update to the Welsh government's LGBTQ+ action plan, published in January, says officials are working to ensure guidance is ready for a new government following May's Senedd election.

Organisers say sponsorship has dwindled over recent years, meaning this weekend's event will be its last.

The UK Supreme Court's definition of a woman in equalities law has significant implications for transgender people.


The trial will assess the risks and benefits of the drugs in children who question their gender.

The landmark decision said "legitimate intimate relationships" must not be "legally invisible".

Text: Ed Miliband has been urged to explain whether a planned boom in energy-hungry data centres have been factored into his plans to deliver net zero carbon emissions.

In a letter to the energy secretary, Labour MP Toby Perkins, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, said data centres are a "key area of concern" in hitting the emissions target.

Data centres are giant facilities full of powerful computers used to run digital services, such as streaming and artificial intelligence (AI).

The government has backed plans for many more to be built to help turn the UK into an "AI superpower", despite the large amounts of electricity needed to run them, including from gas-powered generators.

Perkins said it was concerning that the UK government was relying on an emissions-reduction plan, the Seventh Carbon Budget, that made no allowance for the impact of data centres.

"The issue of data centres and its impact on energy use and emissions have been highlighted as a key area of concern, which is why my committee was concerned by its omission in CB7," Perkins said in his letter to Miliband.

Perkins added: "We would like to know whether this has been accounted for and how, including projections of emissions and possible mitigations."

Miliband's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) told the BBC emissions from data centres "are factored into our modelling".

"We will set out Carbon Budget 7 by June 2026, in line with our statutory duties," a DESNZ spokesperson said.

The government must set this budget by June this year, as part of its legally binding commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The carbon budget is expected to use forecasts of electricity demand that reflect wider economic trends.

But Friends of the Earth said the risks of carbon budgets not being met were "very real".

"The government says that some data centre growth has been factored into their new climate plan," said Mary Stevens, innovation lead and AI campaigner at Friends of the Earth.

"But there are numerous proposals across the UK and if they all get the go-ahead it is difficult to see how they have properly balanced the carbon books."

Last year, the BBC reported that almost 100 new data centres were being planned.

Many of these will be funded by US tech firms, such as Google, and would be based near London.

The UK government has designated data centres as critical national infrastructure, meaning they can not be blocked by local objections.

Perkins is leading an inquiry into the latest carbon-budget proposals from the Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the UK government on net zero.

These proposals suggest a legally binding limit for greenhouse gases emitted in the UK for the period 2038-2042.

The CCC told the BBC the government had not asked it to provide advice specifically on data centres.

Its advice does not mention data centres directly but it does include an expected large increase in the nation's electricity use.

Three charities - Opportunity Green, Foxglove, and Global Action Plan - have warned data centres pose "a risk of substantial carbon emissions that challenge decarbonisation efforts inside UK carbon budgets".

In written evidence submitted to the Environmental Audit Committee's inquiry, the charities said not including data centres in carbon budgets "can only be considered a serious oversight of a major, challenging new source" of emissions.

In their evidence, they said "developers' own figures indicate that just ten of the larger data centres in planning or construction will cause the UK's annual emissions to rise by equivalent to 2.75m tonnes of CO2".

"This partial, conservative figure would all but wipe out the carbon savings expected in 2025 from the switch to electric cars (2.9m tonnes CO2)," the evidence said.

Electricity demand from data centres in Great Britain was estimated to be 7.6TWh in 2025, according to the National Energy System Operator (NESO).

That was about 2% of total electricity demand which, according to Carbon Brief analysis, was 322TWh.

NESO expects data centres to be increasingly used for AI and many of them could install on-site generation fuelled by gas as back-up supply.

But there is high uncertainty over the future growth of data centres, with NESO forecasting electricity demand anywhere between 30TWh and 71TWh by 2050.

One source with knowledge of the government's approach to carbon budgets said DESNZ was not panicked about the growth in data centres.

But, the source added, DESNZ recognises the need to balance the carbon budget if growth is faster than they have accounted for.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wants the UK to become a world leader in artificial intelligence and his government is establishing AI Growth Zones to speed up planning proposals for data centres.

There have been concerns about the impact of data centres, including their water consumption and the effect on household energy bills.

The impact of data centres on energy demand came up during Miliband's appearance in front of the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee on Wednesday.

Miliband said it was "obviously important to take into account the impact of data centres".

But when pressed on whether the Climate Change Committee had accounted for data centres in its latest carbon budget, Miliband said: "I don't know the answer but I'm happy to find out."

Conservative shadow energy security and net zero secretary Claire Coutinho said the UK cannot afford not to be a global frontrunner in AI over the next five years.

She said: "We cannot fall behind in one of the most transformative technologies which can bring growth to Britain because we are worried about domestic emissions targets.

"Those data centres will be built somewhere, just not here in Britain.

"Stopping them being built here won't make a dent on climate change - we will just miss out on the growth and jobs that they could bring us."

It comes in the same week an OpenAI researcher resigned amid concerns about its decision to start testing ChatGPT ads.

Vibe-coding tools - which let people without coding skills create apps using AI - are exploding in popularity.

As hiring rates and job openings drop, some worry a tough job market could be here to stay.

Developing a durable and affordable hand is one of the biggest challenges in robotics.

An AI camera on the A361 in Barnstaple caught a driver steering with one hand while holding a dog.

Text: Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said there is "more to do" after the UK economy saw a lacklustre end to 2025.

The economy grew by 0.1% in the last three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, which was slightly slower than economists had expected.

The ONS said the overall picture for growth towards the end of the year remained "subdued".

Reeves pointed to the full-year figures, saying that the economy's 1.3% growth for the whole of 2025 had topped analysts' forecasts. But the Conservatives said Labour had "weakened our economy".

Labour has made growing the economy its number one priority since coming to power.

But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that there was no growth last quarter in the crucial services sector for the first time in two years, with the slight overall boost to GDP driven by an increase in manufacturing.

The construction sector, meanwhile, suffered its worst quarterly performance in four years, the ONS added.

Reeves said that 2026 would be the year the British public start to feel the positive impacts of Labour's changes.

Speaking to reporters, the chancellor said the UK's economy was the fastest of the European G7 economies in 2025.

"Crucially, GDP per head of the population has increased over the last year after falling in the previous parliament," Reeves added

"Is there more to do? Absolutely. But we've created the conditions for growth and I am confident this will be the year we will see the results of that," she said.

The economy is estimated to have grown by 1.3% for the whole of 2025, a slight uptick from 1.1% growth a year earlier, but lower than the 1.4% forecast by the Bank of England.

In December alone, the economy grew by 0.1%, the ONS figures showed, while November's monthly growth figure was revised down from 0.3% to 0.2%.

Construction activity fell by 2.1% over the final quarter of 2025, with a fall in repair and maintenance work, as well as a drop-off in the amount of new construction work being started.

New private housing saw the third-largest fall in output of the nine construction sectors in the three months to December.

But the ONS said it was the largest contributor overall to the fall in construction output. This is likely to be because it makes up a large share of overall construction activity.

In the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the UK's economic output, the largest drag on growth at the end of the year was professional, scientific and technical activities.

That was following by education, arts, entertainment and recreation, and financial services.

But growth in areas such as administrative services, including travel agencies and tour operators, and IT meant the sector flatlined overall.

The economy was helped in the quarter by Jaguar Land Rover, with the carmaker bringing production back online after a major cyber-attack. But a period of uncertainty in the run-up to November's Budget, with speculation about tax changes, caused companies to withhold investment.

Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, told the BBC's Today programme: "The overall picture as 2025 drew to a close continued to be one of subdued growth."

Ruth Gregory, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the "disappointing" growth figures suggested Britain's economy "still has very little momentum".

Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: "The economy grew in 2025. At the beginning of last year, forecasters said our economy was going to grow by about 1%... we beat those forecasts, the economy grew by 1.3%.

But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said Labour has "weakened our economy".

"These disappointing statistics show a Downing Street and a Treasury that have taken their eye off the ball," he added.

The Liberal Democrats said Reeves' first two Budgets as chancellor had "killed off the economic recovery our country so desperately needs".

Business group the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said 2025 had been "marked by uncertainty and rising costs for firms across the country".

It said surveys of business leaders showed taxes and rising inflation were their top two concerns.

Bosses have consistently complained about the rising tax burden, with particular concerns about how the chancellor's hike in employer National Insurance contributions drove up the cost of hiring for firms.

Nigel Day, who runs a heat pump installation business in Ipswich, said uncertainty around November's Budget had left his customers wary about spending.

He added he had faced difficult choices in order to keep his company in business.

"Increases to the minimum wage have meant that we've not been able to employ the youngsters into the business - they're too expensive to have just as an extra pair of hands," he said. "And we have had to refrain from taking any apprentices."

Last week, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold in a narrow decision, but cut its forecast for economic growth this year to 0.9%, down from a previous prediction of 1.2%.

At the same time, it raised its expectation for the unemployment rate, from an initial forecast of 5% to 5.3%.

This raised expectations of a rate cut in the next few months, and Rob Wood, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest growth figures would do little to stop those in favour from "pushing ahead with a rate cut in March".

However, he added that "economic momentum" would make it the last rate cut of the current cycle.

But Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said an interest rate cut in March was "doubtful".

He said the slight increase in economic output would give policymakers the "comfort" to wait for more evidence inflation is slowing.

Why is the area between the cities so significant and what is East West Rail's role in the project?

The Bank of England has kept borrowing costs unchanged but opened the door to cuts later this year.

The Bank of England may have suggested more rate cuts are on the way, but they are unlikely to go much lower.


UK Inflation has dropped back from record highs but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target.

Text: The government is "united in its position that there are many people who are held back a system that does not work for them" a No 10 spokesman has said after Lisa Nandy described the recent political turbulence as "unforgivable".

Speaking to the Guardian, the culture secretary said: "It does look to people outside that we're more interested in ourselves and less interested in preventing chaos."

She said the government had "not done enough" adding: "This has to be the moment of reckoning."

Asked if the prime minister agreed with Nandy, his official spokesman said: "What she has said is the country isn't working for everyone - the prime minister agrees with that."

"The PM is fighting for the millions of people in poverty who are held back by a system that  doesn't work for them," he added.

Nandy's comments come after a difficult few days for the prime minister which has seen around half a dozen Labour MPs and the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar call for his resignation.

Sir Keir Starmer is also facing questions over his appointment of Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador in the US, despite his known links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

A show of cabinet support on Monday meant Sir Keir survived the challenge from Sarwar, however he remains in a fragile position and senior ministers appear to be feeling more freedom to speak and act independently.

On Tuesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting, circumnavigated an ongoing government process to publish communications related to the appointment of Lord Mandelson, by unilaterally releasing his own messages with the former Labour peer.

Now Nandy has given an interview to the Guardian which includes criticism of the government's record.

Speaking to the newspaper, she said: "At times in our history in the Labour movement we've understood that our job is not just about redistributing wealth, it's about who holds power. I think we've forgotten it.

"We've not done enough, and this has got to be the moment of reckoning where we say not just what are we here for, but who are we here for?"

She said MPs wanted the government to be "bigger and bolder" and that ministers needed to "wear our colours on our sleeves again".

She also said the "culture" of the Labour Party had to change.

"We've got to be more open and porous and respectful of different points of view."

Asked if her interview was the start of a potential leadership bid, the Wigan MP, who lost out to Sir Keir in the 2020 Labour contest, replied "God no."

She added: "I think there are things the country needs to hear from us; they need to understand that we see and we acknowledge our mistakes."

Despite the difficult week, Sir Keir sought to strike a defiant tone, telling reporters on Tuesday that he would "never walk away from the country that I love".

He said he was fighting for the "millions of people held back because of a system that doesn't work for them", adding: "I will never give up on that fight."

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the Labour Party had "lost confidence in Keir Starmer" and that it was "a matter of when, not if" he had to resign.

Maryam Eslamdoust, head of the Labour-affiliated Transport Salaried Staffs' Association trade union, has said she wanted former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner to replace Sir Keir.

Speaking to the Guardian, she said Sir Keir should step down if Labour lose the Gorton and Denton by-election and that Rayner was a "credible figure" to take over.

A spokesperson for Rayner said: "There is no context and no vacancy. Angela has been clear Labour must come together, avoid distraction and work as a team to deliver for the public."

The prime minister has faced months of questions about his leadership in the face of low poll ratings and series of policy U-turns.

The latest row has been triggered by information released in the Epstein files including indications Lord Mandelson accepted money from the US financier, as well as allegedly forwarding him confidential government emails as a minister.

Sir Keir had already sacked Lord Mandelson after a previous release of Epstein documents, however Labour MPs have questioned why he was appointed in the first place.

There has also been concern in the Parliamentary Labour Party about the prime minister awarding his former communications chief Matthew Doyle a peerage, despite his links to a sex offender.


In a statement he said: "At the point of my campaigning support, Morton repeatedly asserted to all those who knew him his innocence, including initially in court.

"To have not ceased support ahead of a judicial conclusion was a clear error of judgement for which I apologise unreservedly.

"Following his conviction any contact was extremely limited and I have not seen or spoken to him in years. Twice I was at events organised by other people, which he attended, and once I saw him to check on his welfare after concerns were raised through others."

On Tuesday, Lord Doyle was suspended from Labour's parliamentary party.

Challenged on the peerage at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said Lord Doyle had not given "a full account of his actions".

Lord Doyle has not yet responded to the prime minister's accusation.


Female Labour figures say the prime minister told them he understood the need to end a "boy's club" mentality in No 10.

The Scottish Labour leader made his biggest political play by calling for the prime minister to stand down earlier this week.

Lord Doyle apologises for his past association with a former Labour councillor who admitted indecent child image offences.

It comes after the Scottish Labour leader called for the prime minister to quit at a dramatic press conference on Monday.

Text: To tackle the menace of extortion rackets being operated by gangsters from abroad, the Delhi Police is looking at devising a new strategy — mapping the city’s major clubs and bars.

Sources said this move comes after a sudden surge in extortion cases targeting businessmen — property dealers, jewellers, sweet shop owners, second-hand car dealers and factory owners — in the city. Sometimes, they turn deadly. Earlier this week, a businessman in the Bawana Industrial Area was shot dead allegedly by shooters of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang after reportedly intervening in an extortion call.

Sources said the exercise, currently in the planning stage, is set to be carried out at clubs and bars of South, West and East Delhi, which are frequented by businessmen. For this, a dedicated Special Cell team will coordinate with the local police. The police plan to screen workers and check if they are passing any information about them, The Indian Express has learnt.

The plan

For the police, the biggest challenge so far was ascertaining who was passing on information about businessmen to gangsters.

A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, told The Indian Express, “Famous businessmen, punters, bookies, politicians or celebrities remain prime targets for criminals. However, in the past few months, it has been noticed that businessmen who are neither well known nor particularly wealthy have also been receiving extortion calls.”

“It is suspected that businessmen often hold meetings and parties in clubs and bars, from where information about them could be leaked. This might be one of the sources of information for criminals operating from abroad,” the officer said.

Police have prepared an elaborate plan to verify employees, workers, and regular visitors at these clubs and bars, said sources, adding that the exercise will be carried out at premises in South, West and East Delhi.

Anatomy of an extortion racket

According to another police officer, these gangs used to make their money through illegal businesses such as the drug and firearm trade. In recent years, however, extortion has been their major source of “revenue”.

How does it work?

First, police said, a businessman — their potential target — is identified through local networks.

Then, Whatsapp calls are made via “dabba calling”, a sophisticated extortion technique. In this, the henchman would allegedly place an extortion call to his intended victim using the Internet. Next, he would place a second call using another phone to his boss sitting in a different country, keep the two phones side-by-side, turn on their speakers, and allegedly let his boss do the talking.

The gangs sometimes send voice notes threatening the businessman on WhatsApp. If their target does not respond to the demand, warning messages are sent via WhatsApp.

And if the businessman still continues to ignore them, police said armed men are sent to fire shots at his house or office as a warning.
The officer said that in many cases, businessmen become so terrified by such threats that they do not even report the matter to the police and often end up paying the money.

According to Delhi Police data, officials managed to solve around 65% of extortion cases registered in the city in 2025.

However, police said the situation on the ground remains challenging as they’ve only been able to apprehend ground-level operatives who carried out shootings. The masterminds who planned these attacks are rarely identified as the gangs operate primarily by invoking the names of its leaders, they said.

Big names running rackets

Lawrence Bishnoi gang: While the gangster himself is lodged in Gujarat’s Sabarmati Jail, police said his gang is allegedly being operated by Randeep Malik, Anil Pandit, and Harry Boxer from US and Canada.

In the past six months, around 10 businessmen have approached Delhi Police after receiving extortion threats from the gang. Earlier this month, the gang allegedly demanded Rs 5 crore from businessmen in the Paschim Vihar and West Vinod Nagar areas.

Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu gang: Sangwan allegedly runs his gang from the UK. He became notorious for extorting Southwest Delhi businessmen. In May, last year, he had allegedly demanded Rs 2 crore from a businessman in Southwest Delhi.

Himanshu Bhau gang: Bhau, from Hisar, runs his network from the US. In July last year, his aides had allegedly demanded Rs 10 crore from a Delhi Police official posted in the West district.

Goldy Brar, Rohit Godara: They reportedly issued threats using VOIP technology, demanding crores, including Rs 2 crore from a Delhi businessman in April last year. Formerly part of the Bishnoi gang, they now operate separately.

Neeraj Bawana gang: Delhi’s most wanted criminal until his arrest in 2015, Bawana is now lodged in Tihar Jail. His associates run the gang through robbery and extortion from businessmen.

Text: An AI safety researcher has quit US firm Anthropic with a cryptic warning that the "world is in peril".

In his resignation letter shared on X, Mrinank Sharma told the firm he was leaving amid concerns about AI, bioweapons and the state of the wider world.

He said he would instead look to pursue writing and studying poetry, and move back to the UK to "become invisible".

It comes in the same week that an OpenAI researcher said she had resigned, sharing concerns about the ChatGPT maker's decision to deploy adverts in its chatbot.

Anthropic, best known for its Claude chatbot, had released a series of commercials aimed at OpenAI, criticising the company's move to include adverts for some users.

The company, which was formed in 2021 by a breakaway team of early OpenAI employees, has positioned itself as having a more safety-orientated approach to AI research compared with its rivals.

Sharma led a team there which researched AI safeguards.

He said in his resignation letter his contributions included investigating why generative AI systems suck up to users, combatting AI-assisted bioterrorism risks and researching "how AI assistants could make us less human".

But he said despite enjoying his time at the company, it was clear "the time has come to move on".

"The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment," Sharma wrote.

He said he had "repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions" - including at Anthropic which he said "constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most".

Sharma said he would instead look to pursue a poetry degree and writing.

He added in a reply: "I'll be moving back to the UK and letting myself become invisible for a period of time."

Those departing AI firms which have loomed large in the latest generative AI boom - and sought to retain talent with huge salaries or compensation offers - often do so with plenty of shares and benefits intact.

Anthropic calls itself a "public benefit corporation dedicated to securing [AI's] benefits and mitigating its risks".

In particular, it has focused on preventing those it believes are posed by more advanced frontier systems, such as them becoming misaligned with human values, misused in areas such as conflict or too powerful.

It has released reports on the safety of its own products, including when it said its technology had been "weaponised" by hackers to carry out sophisticated cyber attacks.

But it has also come under scrutiny over its practices. In 2025, it agreed to pay $1.5bn (£1.1bn) to settle a class action lawsuit filed by authors who said the company stole their work to train its AI models.

Like OpenAI, the firm also seeks to seize on the technology's benefits, including through its own AI products such as its ChatGPT rival Claude.

It recently released a commercial that criticised OpenAI's move to start running ads in ChatGPT.

OpenAI boss Sam Altman had previously said he hated ads and would use them as a "last resort".

Last week, he hit back at the advert's description of this as a "betrayal" - but was mocked for his lengthy post criticising Anthropic.

A former OpenAI researcher who resigned this week, in part due to fears of the use of advertising on ChatGPT, has told BBC Newsnight she feels "really nervous about working in the industry".

Zoe Hitzig said her concerns stemmed from the possible psychosocial impacts of a "new type of social interaction" that were not yet understood.

She noted "early warning signs" that dependence on AI tools were "worrisome" and could "reinforce certain kinds of delusions" as well as negatively impacting users' mental health in other ways.

"Creating an economic engine that profits from encouraging these kinds of new relationships before we understand them is really dangerous," she continued.

"We saw what happened with social media" she said, noting "there's still time to set up the social institutions, the forms of regulation that can actually govern this". It was, she said, a "critical moment".

Responding to BBC News, a spokesperson for OpenAI pointed to the firm's principles which state: "Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible."

They add: "We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers."

'It is frustrating that I don't have the chance to vote them out'

A Conservative council is under fire following a massive pothole incident that left dozens of vehicles damaged despite promising to prioritise "improving our roads" in the wake of scrapping local elections.

Suffolk County Council is one of the 30 authorities which cancelled the vote in May over claims that county reorganisation made it too expensive, time-consuming and complicated to organise.

In the wake of the announcement, council leader Matthew Hicks said the cancellation would allow the authority to focus on highway repairs.

However, a 5ft-long, 5in-deep crater on a busy road between Bungay and Beccles caused widespread disruption, with motorists suffering punctured tyres and bent wheel rims on the 50mph stretch.

The hazard remained inadequately addressed for two days, marked only by a few orange cones while drivers were forced into oncoming traffic to avoid it.

Located near Deer Row at Mettingham, the pothole was flagged to Suffolk Highways through at least eight online reports on Monday alone.

Suffolk Constabulary confirmed officers were dispatched to the scene at 5.36pm after numerous vehicles hit the water-filled crater, with many drivers pulling over due to punctures.

Police placed cones and warning signs to alert approaching motorists.

Julie Kenny, a 53-year-old carer from Halesworth, struck the hazard at around 5.30pm on Monday, puncturing her Suzuki's front left tyre.

"There were as many as 20 or 30 cars that had to stop after going through it," she said, adding that she contacted police, fearing a motorcyclist could be seriously injured.

Jordan Hindes, who previously served as Bungay's mayor, was among those caught out by the water-filled hazard on Monday evening.

The 32-year-old electronics engineer recounted driving his Kia Ceed when he suddenly heard "two really great bangs" before pulling over alongside roughly a dozen other stranded motorists.

"It was a mammoth pothole," Mr Hindes explained, describing the scene as "a real s***show" with multiple recovery vehicles and police eventually arriving to assist.

Mr Hindes voiced particular frustration at the cancelled elections, arguing that without the opportunity to vote, residents cannot hold the council accountable.

"It is frustrating that I don't have the chance to vote them out," he told The Telegraph.

A council spokesman said the defect was reported on Monday evening, inspected and made safe before being repaired urgently.

"We appreciate how frustrated road users are about potholes," the spokesman said.

"The team is working hard during what is the busiest time of year to inspect and repair potholes and other defects across the 4,000 miles of road we are responsible for."

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who had previously "declared war" on potholes, has vowed to scrap the law that allowed local authorities to cancel elections due to be held in May.

On February 19 and 20, a legal challenge launched by the party to oppose the move will be heard in court.

Councils across the country were offered the chance to request a postponement by submitting a request to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Steve Reed.

The funding shortfall has been exacerbated by fewer people opting to pay the annual licence fee.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 08:37 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 08:37 AM

LONDON - The BBC said on Feb 12 it expects to make further savings of around 10 per cent of its costs over the next three years in answer to “substantial financial pressures”.

The British broadcaster did not specify the amount it aims to save, but other British media reported it was up to £600 million (S$1.03 billion) and would involve job losses and some programming cuts as it copes with squeezed funding.

“In a rapidly changing media market, we continue to face substantial financial pressures,” a BBC spokesperson said in a statement.

“As a result we expect to make further savings over the next three years of around 10 per cent of our costs,” the statement added, noting “this is about the BBC becoming more productive and prioritising our offer to audiences”.

The funding shortfall has been exacerbated by fewer people opting to pay the annual licence fee, which is mandatory for every UK household watching live television channels.

The yearly fee, on which the BBC relies heavily, is currently £174.50.

The broadcaster collected £3.8 billion from over 23 million licences in 2024-2025, but 3.6 million households declared they did not need one, according to a recent parliamentary committee report.

More than £1.1 billion was lost in revenues over the same period as people legitimately refused or dodged the fee, it found.

The BBC is also grappling with wider changes in media consumption, such as streaming and on-demand services.

The latest cutbacks – following more than half a billion pounds worth of savings over the last three years – come against the backdrop of turbulence sparked by the misleading edit of a speech by US President Donald Trump.

Text: Snow covered peak a Glenmore, Scotland shining in the February sunshine

Two Met Office yellow weather warnings are in force for snow and ice across Scotland and northern England as Arctic air is poised to make a return.

Friday will feel much colder for the UK with temperatures plummeting overnight bringing the first widespread frost of February.

This marks a significant change in our weather, after weeks of record-breaking damp and dismal weather caused by a "blocked" weather pattern, external.

But some good news as the city of Aberdeen saw its first ray of sunshine on Thursday after three weeks of gloom.

Met office yellow warning areas for snow and ice

A yellow warning is in force for snow and ice overnight on Thursday and into Friday for Scotland. Snow amounts of a few centimetres even on lower roads could be in store by Friday morning.

On hills above 300m there could be up to 2 to 5cm, with 10cm possible in places.

In addition to the snow, ice will also be a hazard.

A second yellow warning for snow and ice is also in force for northern England and the north Midlands.  Here snow will fall at low levels but is not likely to settle below 200 metres. These higher levels could see 2 to 5cm and it's expected that a few locations above 300m may see as much as 10 cm.

This is likely to cause disruption on routes across the Pennines and for Derbyshire and Cumbria. With temperatures plummeting below freezing overnight, the combination of snow and ice could lead to treacherous conditions on untreated roads and pavements.

Saturday will start cold and frosty with the whole of the UK seeing some sunshine and should be the driest day for a good while.

However Saturday night and Sunday brings a renewed risk of snow, quite widely and even at low levels. Keep checking the BBC Weather website and app for all the latest details.

And the hour-by-hour forecast for your area is always available on the BBC Weather website and app.

Yet another day of cloudy skies over Aberdeen

It's been wet and grey for many parts of the UK - none more so that the city of Aberdeen in north-east Scotland.

After three weeks of gloom the Sun finally made a welcome return to the skies between 15:00 and 16:00 on Thursday afternoon.

Although its appearance only lasted for just over 30 minutes it was enough to signal the end of the record breaking cloud cover the city had seen.

Surrounding areas in north-east Scotland might well have seen a little blue sky on Thursday too, but Friday is the day when the cycle will be properly broken and the sunshine will return more widely.

Across England 75 flood warnings remain in place with the Environment Agency warning of "ongoing flooding from groundwater probable" for parts of Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire, West Sussex and possibly Kent as well as an ongoing flood risk from rivers across Somerset and Wiltshire and the River Trent.

UK Flood Warnings

Aberdeen finally sees sunshine after 21 days of gloom

In response to the forecast Arctic blast, the UK's Health Security Agency has also issued yellow alerts, external for the colder weather across northern England and the Midlands, from 06:00 GMT Friday to 08:00 Monday.

They warn that the weather is likely to have "minor impacts on health and social care services, including increased use of healthcare services and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people".

Temperatures will stay below average over the weekend, returning to more what we'd expect of around 2-5C by Tuesday.

Text: A songwriter who has worked with Charli XCX on her biggest hits says doing the Wuthering Heights soundtrack was the perfect pivot after their Brat summer.

Finn Keane has worked with the pop star on loads of previous projects and won a Grammy for producing her hit Von Dutch.

That track, along with the rest of her electro and dance-inspired Brat album, inspired a lime green cultural phenomenon that took over 2024.

Charli herself declared Brat summer over in September that year - when it turns out she was already thinking about doing something completely different.

Keane says it was around that time they both "fell in love" when they saw the script for Emerald Fennell's movie adaption of the Emily Brontë classic.

He tells BBC Newsbeat the darker themes of Wuthering Heights "felt like the perfect counterpoint and pivot away from Brat".

"We were really ready to do something completely different, not in the dance world.

"Charli loves working in opposites and extremes and this felt like a really exciting next step for her artistry.

"We were just so excited to try something completely different and hopefully something that was kind of surprising on some level."

Keane says the pair first started working on the soundtrack while they were touring the Brat remix album.

"Initially it was like, "Oh, should we do one song?," Finn says.

"Then Charli was like, 'Let's do a whole album. I love it so much, I'm feeling really inspired'.

"We'd play these shows and then when Charli had an hour or two off, we'd go into a studio or just work in a hotel room and make songs for the soundtrack."

Keane also worked with Charli on Speed Drive for the Barbie soundtrack, but Wuthering Heights came with a very different brief.

They used orchestral elements - recorded at Abbey Road Studios - to help with the gothic feel.

But Keane says he even picked up an instrument himself because they wanted it to "feel really rough".

"There's a lot of me playing a really cheap, small violin," he says.

"And I can't really play the violin. So it was me just doing these horrible, scratchy sounds.

"When you listen to it, if you hear some really bad raspy playing, that's going to be me rather than the amazing professionals we brought in."

Speaking to the BBC at the film's UK premiere, Charli said she was inspired by artists like The Cure and Kate Bush - whose debut single Wuthering Heights was a number one hit in the 1970s.

Keane agrees, and says they also were inspired by 83-year-old Welsh musician John Cale, who features on House - the first single released from the soundtrack.

"When John Cale sends you this amazing spoken-word poem over music you've made, that's just unreal," he says, describing it as a "pinch me" moment.

The soundtrack, which Charli teased a setlist for on Instagram in January, features 12 tracks including a collab with Tumblr icon Sky Ferreira.

For Keane, it was completely different to working on Brat - which was "just Charli saying, 'I want to make my album that I think is great, I don't care who's going to listen to it'."

"We wanted it to feel really emotional, like a proper film score as well as a Charli XCX song as well," he says.

"I think it was that thing of trying to balance those two things of making it feel like a really strong song but also a piece that would perfectly fit in a movie and have this emotional depth to it."

Keane's excited for people to see the "visually stunning" film - which he says is "so dark and just so beautiful".

"I hope when people hear the music, and they see it with the story that they feel really moved.

"I also hope they feel it's a different part of Charli's artistry, to see that she can make this kind of music as well as do something as incredible as Brat."

Even if you've only seen the trailer, or clips on TikTok, you'll probably know two things about the film: it's gothic and it's raunchy.

So if you're planning to go and watch it, Keane's got some advice.

"Go see it in the cinema, just don't go with your parents, take a date."

Wuthering Heights opens in UK cinemas on 13 February - Charli XCX's soundtrack is out on the same day.

Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

How much attention did you pay to what happened in the world over the past seven days?

Sister Sledge join Craig David, Blue and Madness at a new beach festival in Weston-super-Mare.

In a statement published online the band said Ranken was the "heartbeat of The Pogues".


She is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m.

Donald Trump’s sustained pressure for fairer burden-sharing has opened a real door, writes the US columnist

Thank goodness for Donald Trump, who seems more focused on Britain’s interests than its own Prime Minister, whose crisis of confidence is now on display to the entire world.

NATO allies, responding to sustained pressure from Trump for fairer burden-sharing, have agreed to place Britain in operational leadership of Joint Force Command Norfolk, a joint operational level command part of Nato — a clear elevation of UK sovereignty and defence authority — precisely as Keir Starmer’s government continues to destroy Britain’s independent strength through renewed deference to Brussels, risky economic overtures to Beijing, and persistent failure to secure the borders.

For years, European governments acted like children under permanent American protection, assuming the United States would underwrite their security forever.

It took a president willing to face elite outrage to state the obvious: Europe must shoulder its own defence burden. The need for such bluntness indicts Europe, not America.

America is Nato backbone — its funding, logistics, carrier groups, nuclear umbrella, and cultural confidence keep the alliance alive.

Strip that away, and Nato is a committee with a flag. Those offended by the directness should face the arithmetic: without America, Europe stands exposed. That truth deserves respect and gratitude from a continent liberated at enormous Allied cost.

For Britain, Trump’s sustained pressure for fairer burden-sharing has opened a real door. Nato's intensified focus on Atlantic sea lanes, Arctic deterrence, and undersea infrastructure protection matches Britain’s geography and strengths perfectly.

Joint Force Command Norfolk — safeguarding the Atlantic lifeline — now falls under British operational leadership as part of Nato's collective elevation of European roles.

Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed doubling troops in Norway from 1,000 to 2,000 over three years, with UK forces central to the new Arctic Sentry mission and leading joint exercises against Russian hybrid threats. This is not a ceremony. It is post-Brexit statecraft—Britain stepping up where it can exert genuine influence.

Now look at the policy reality under Starmer.


Starmer promised seriousness. What has emerged is managerial calamity when strategic clarity is required. Defence rhetoric has stiffened, but the fiscal commitment for rearmament lags badly.

New spending seems easier to justify for social transfers than for ships, munitions, and readiness.

A nation claiming Atlantic leadership cannot credibly do so while its Armed Forces stretch thinning resources across growing demands.

Downing Street’s January Beijing visit yielded £2.2billion in export deals, £2.3billion in market access over five years, and hundreds of millions in investments — including £250million potential from whisky tariff cuts. Trade serves statecraft; it is not statecraft itself.

Energy policy worsens the bind. The Ofgem cap sits at £1,758 for a typical household — still 45 per cent above pre-Ukraine levels and 69 per cent higher than winter 2020/21. Industrial costs erode competitiveness.

Net-zero targets remain untouchable despite questions over grid reliability, baseload power, and affordability. Energy security underpins national security. Pricing the industry into fragility cripples the capacity to fund defence and deterrence.

Borders tell the same story. The Government vowed to “smash the gangs”. Small-boat crossings hit over 41,000 in 2025—the second-highest annual total ever, up 13 per cent from 2024 — with high numbers continuing into early 2026. Adjustments have not delivered the decisive drop that would signal control restored.

This is no accident. It stems from a governing instinct: alignment with Brussels on regulation, global climate frameworks on virtue, and multilateral processes on migration. Presented as pragmatism, it erodes leverage. The rhetoric is moderate. The result is drift.

Across the Channel, the pattern repeats. Decades of underspending on defence while leaning on American power. The two per cent target is treated as optional.

Strategic autonomy is proclaimed far more than funded. Only Washington’s “extreme rhetoric” prompted modest increases. That is not a European triumph. It is prolonged complacency.

Memory matters too. Allied soldiers — American, British, Canadian—died by the thousands while liberating Europe. Britain repaid its Second World War loans only in 2004.

Respect should be shown in a serious defence effort. Instead, many settled into dependency. Freeloading is rude. It is also accurate.

France talks European leadership, but gains no comparable command in this realignment. Germany announces turning points and struggles to deliver. Britain — outside the EU, tied to the Special Relationship — holds a unique position: nuclear deterrent, global maritime reach, Five Eyes integration, Atlantic tradition. Geography and history favour it.

Opportunity does not ensure success.

A government fixated on Brussels resets, Beijing commercial deals, and palatable energy stories will squander an opening built on deterrence and resilience. Sovereignty is not words.

It is brigades, stockpiles, secure borders, and reliable power. It rests on cultural confidence: the assumption that national interest is legitimate and defence an obligation.

The world has hardened. Russian hybrids hit the High North infrastructure. Chinese strategies target ports and chains. American patience for free-riding has limits. Facts, not speculation.

Britain faces a choice. Persist in managerial disaster — neutralising borders, rationalising costly energy, constraining defence, balancing foreign policy carefully — and watch as its global integrity combusts.

Or treat American burden-sharing demands as a correction, not an insult. Restore energy realism, match defence funding to rhetoric, enforce borders decisively, and handle China with sobriety. Act as a sovereign state in a dangerous decade.

History rarely rewards mistaking comfort for strength. Britain still holds serious power instruments, but under Starmer’s leadership, they are receding every day.

Four MPs have defected to Reform UK since the 2024 General Election

MPs will debate changing the law on holding by-elections if an MP switches allegiance following a series of defections from the Tories to Reform UK.

The petition, which surpassed 128,000 signatures, surged after Newark MP Robert Jenrick and Romford MP Andrew Rosindell crossed the floor to Nigel Farage's party.

Almost 1,000 people signed the petition in Suella Braverman's constituency of Fareham & Waterlooville, with just over 500 backing automatic by-elections in Danny Kruger's seat of East Wiltshire.

The debate, which will be opened by Liberal Democrat MP Dr Roz Savage, will take place at 4.30pm on March 16.

Sir Keir Starmer's Government is expected to send a minister to respond to Dr Savage.

The Cabinet Office said: "It is an established constitutional principle that at UK General Elections, voters cast their vote for individual candidates, and not the political party they represent.

"When a Member of Parliament (MP) decides to change their party affiliation, it is for the MP to decide whether to continue to sit in the House of Commons (as a representative of their new political party or as an independent MP) or to stand down from their seat to trigger a by-election and, if they wish, seek re-election.

"There are no plans to make changes to the current arrangements."

Despite criticisms about Reform UK's newest recruits, by-elections have rarely been held as a result of a defection throughout Britain's political history.

The two most significant recent examples came in 2014, when Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless held onto Clacton and Rochester & Strood after leaving the Tories for Ukip.

Other examples include William Allen Jowitt's defection from the Liberals to Labour in 1929, Dick Taverne's 1973 change from Labour to Democratic Labour and Bruce Douglas-Mann's defeat in the 1982 Mitcham & Morden by-election.

There have been at least two recent attempts to change the law on holding by-elections as a result of a defection.

The debate, which will be opened by Liberal Democrat MP Dr Roz Savage, will take place at 4.30pm on March 16

PETITIONS COMMITTEE

Ex-Tory MP Chris Skidmore proposed requiring a by-election in 2011.

A similar private members' bill was brought forward by Anthony Mangnall following a series of defections to Change UK and the Liberal Democrats during the Brexit years.

However, Reform UK is not the only political party to recently benefit from defections.

Labour welcomed a number of Tories into its ranks ahead of the 2024 General Election, including Christian Wakeford, Dan Poulter and Natalie Elphicke.

Meanwhile, Paul Marsden switched from Labour to the Liberal Democrats during Tony Blair's stint as Prime Minister.

Alan Howarth made history with his defection in 1995, later becoming the only politician since 1979 to serve as a Government Minister for two different parties.

Ex-Basingstoke MP Andrew Hunter raised eyebrows in 2004 when he opted to defect to the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party.

However, following Lee Anderson's switch to Reform UK ahead of the 2024 General Election, Mr Farage has decided not to hold by-elections for his switchers.

Lee Anderson defected to Reform UK ahead of the 2024 General Election

An Ipsos poll conducted in 2024 suggested a plurality of Britons would support holding a by-election if an MP switches allegiance.

Almost half - 49 per cent - of respondents backed holding a by-election.

Meanwhile, 23 per cent claimed Mr Anderson's defection was close enough to the upcoming general election not to require a snap poll.

Reform UK is hoping more Tory MPs will defect to Reform ahead of the 2026 Local Elections, with Mr Farage giving potential switchers just 83 days to make the move.

Gordon Brown has demanded that police question Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor regarding his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The former Prime Minister submitted letters to both the Metropolitan Police and Essex Police requesting they launch an investigation into the matter.

Writing in the New Statesman, Mr Brown expressed his alarm at what the recently released Epstein files reveal about Britain's previously unrecognised involvement in the trafficking scandal.

"It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all," the former Labour leader stated.

Mr Brown described himself as "shocked" by the extent of the abuse uncovered in the documents, which detail how Epstein's network operated through British airports and involved UK victims.

Emails contained within the files indicate that British girls were transported on approximately 90 flights departing from UK airports aboard Epstein's aircraft, infamously dubbed the "Lolita Express".

Particularly disturbing is that 15 of these journeys received approval following Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.

"How the flights were allowed to continue should have been fully investigated," Mr Brown wrote.

The documents also expose how Stansted airport served as a hub for trafficking young women from Eastern Europe, with girls brought in from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia.

One email referenced in the files, titled "the girl", reportedly described a victim as "just turned 18, 179cm, very cute, speaks English, I saw her in real 3 years ago i will send you the video in next email".

Mr Brown asserted that at least one of these flights had been directly connected to the former prince, who was stripped of his royal titles last year due to his association with Epstein.

"The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew," he wrote, having formally requested police examine this evidence as part of any new inquiry.

The former Prime Minister also questioned the effectiveness of British authorities, claiming they had "little or no idea who was being trafficked through our country, and for whom other than Epstein".

Appearing in the Epstein files is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and inclusion in the documents does not implicate anyone in Epstein's criminality.

He argued that sexual offences committed on British soil should never be treated as secondary concerns simply because investigations are being conducted elsewhere.

"The evidence suggests some in the UK were complicit in trafficking. This demands a full inquiry," Mr Brown stated.

Mr Brown has urged the Metropolitan Police to urgently reconsider their previous decisions on the case, noting he has been privately informed that earlier investigations failed to properly examine crucial flight evidence.

The Met previously concluded in 2016 that any trafficking inquiry would primarily concern activities outside British jurisdiction, meaning they were not the appropriate body to pursue a full criminal investigation. This position was reviewed in August 2019 but remained unchanged.

Thames Valley Police are currently assessing separate allegations that Andrew shared confidential government reports with Epstein during his time as UK trade envoy, holding discussions with Crown Prosecution Service specialists.

Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson confirmed on Wednesday that prosecutors remain in close contact with both forces but have not yet received a formal request for advice.

Buckingham Palace stated on Monday that it would "stand ready to support" police should they seek assistance with their inquiries into the claims.

A spokesman confirmed that the King had conveyed his "profound concern" regarding the allegations against his younger brother.

Andrew, who remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his princely title and dukedom, has consistently denied any wrongdoing throughout the scandal.

Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, had alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including once in London when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein.

The former prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022, which contained no admission of liability.

GB News has contacted Andrew's representatives for comment.

Text: 





















When people encounter racism or discrimination, they don’t all respond in the same way. Some calmly challenge the remark, some file a complaint, others confront the offender aggressively – and many say nothing at all.

A common assumption is that speaking up against discrimination is a matter of personal courage, political ideology or education. But my recent research suggests that people’s cultural values, shaped by their backgrounds and life experiences, strongly influence how they confront discrimination.

Confrontation comes in very different forms. Some choose to confront non-aggressively (such as calmly pointing out prejudice, explaining why it is offensive or sharing how it impacts them emotionally). Others prefer relatively more aggressive confrontation (such as shouting back, threatening or physical retaliation). These responses carry different risks and consequences, both for the person confronting and for wider social relations.

My recent study with colleagues Thomas Kessler and Ayşe K Uskul looked at how people’s cultural views of honour affected how they might respond to an insult or discrimination.

Honour is often misunderstood as a personal trait or a relic of “traditional” cultures. In psychology, honour is better understood as a cultural system that develops when people cannot rely on institutions – such as courts or police – to protect them from harm or injustice.

Honour cultures, common in Latin America, North Africa, South and West Asia and the southern US, often developed under harsh historical, social and ecological conditions, for example, scarce resources unprotected by central authorities.

In such contexts, reputation matters. Maintaining honour requires projecting a reputation for toughness. It means signalling a readiness to retaliate against perceived threats or insults to protect oneself and one’s family.

Being seen as weak or passive can invite further mistreatment, so individuals and groups learn to defend their dignity themselves. Honour codes travel with people through migration, continuing to shape how they interpret threats, insults and unfair treatment in new social environments.

Our study sought to understand how internalised honour codes shape responses to discrimination. Specifically, we looked at two communities: south and west Asians in the UK and Turkish migrants in Germany.

People in these communities may have grown up in an honour culture, where personal retaliation against insults is expected. Or, they may have learned these codes from parents and grandparents, while living in countries where such codes are not widespread.

Our findings show that honour codes play a central role in how people say they would confront discrimination. We asked participants a series of questions about their views on honour, as well as their experiences of discrimination. We then asked them to rate the different confrontation styles that they might use when someone discriminates against them based on their ethnic or cultural background.

We found that broadly, people who experienced discrimination more frequently said they were more likely to confront it. But the style of confrontation they chose depended strongly on their cultural values.

A key finding concerned collective honour: the belief that you have a responsibility to defend the dignity of your ethnic or cultural group. Participants who strongly endorsed collective honour reported they were more likely to confront prejudice in any form, whether calmly or aggressively. For them, remaining silent felt like allowing an insult to stand.

In contrast to those who view honour as a collective quality, there are also those who view honour as more of an individual, internalised quality. This can manifest in how people rate the importance of family reputation, and their readiness for retaliation against insults.

People who emphasised family reputation values – concern with maintaining respectability and avoiding shame – said they were more likely to confront discrimination in non-aggressive ways. They also reported being less likely to respond aggressively. Maintaining dignity, for them, meant self-control.

Those who strongly endorsed retaliation values – belief that failing to respond to insults signals weakness and dishonour – were more likely to confront prejudice aggressively and less likely to use calmer strategies. In other words, honour does not push people uniformly toward violence or to remain silent. Different honour codes lead to very different ways of speaking up.

Interestingly, broader structural factors – such as financial insecurity or distrust in the police and authorities – played a smaller role than expected in how people responded to discrimination. What mattered most was how often people actually experienced discrimination.

Repeated exposure to discrimination increased the likelihood of aggressive confrontation, especially among those who endorsed retaliation norms. This suggests that speaking up is shaped less by abstract perceptions of injustice and more by life experiences.

Political rhetoric around immigration has contributed to a broader climate of hostility and suspicion of some communities. This is evident in the waves of anti-immigration protests the UK has seen in recent years, and their effects on communities. According to Home Office data released in late 2025, police recorded 10,097 racially or religiously aggravated offences in August 2024 alone.

Against this backdrop, those who speak up – whether in calm advocacy or in heated confrontation – risk being judged against a narrow standard of “civility” that disregards the personal and cultural experiences that shape their responses.

For some people, walking away preserves dignity. For others, it undermines it. This does not mean all confrontational responses are equally effective or desirable.

But it does mean that judging these responses without understanding their cultural roots risks blaming individuals for navigating systems that were never designed to protect them. If we want more constructive conversations about discrimination and how we speak up against it, our research can offer a place to start.

Additional charges on overnight stays could add more than £100 to the cost of a typical family break

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing mounting pressure from the hospitality industry after approximately 200 major accommodation businesses demanded she abandon controversial plans for a so-called "holiday tax" in England.

Leading firms have signed an open letter coordinated by trade body UKHospitality urging the Government to drop the proposed visitor levy.

The industry chiefs warned that the additional charges on overnight stays could add more than £100 to the cost of a typical family break.

The firms that signed the open letter include Butlin's, Hilton, Travelodge, Haven and Merlin Entertainments, which operates Legoland and the London Eye.

According to UKHospitality's calculations, a levy of just £2 per person per night would increase the bill for a family of four taking a fortnight's summer holiday by £112.

"Holidays are for relaxing, not taxing," the business leaders told Ms Reeves in their letter, arguing the measure would disproportionately burden families.

The proposed levy was confirmed during last year's autumn budget, when Ms Reeves announced that regional mayors across England would be granted powers to impose charges on overnight accommodation including hotels, Airbnbs and holiday lets.

The scheme follows similar measures already devolved to Scotland and Wales, with the intention of providing local leaders with additional funding for infrastructure and transport improvements.

Several mayors have already signalled their enthusiasm for the new powers. Both London and Liverpool have indicated they plan to introduce levies once the legislation takes effect.

The charges would apply across various types of paid accommodation, from major hotel chains to bed and breakfasts and holiday parks.

Industry figures have expressed alarm that the tax could also affect business travellers attending conferences and meetings, potentially driving up costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers.

The accommodation bosses cautioned that families would bear the brunt of the new charges, with many forced to cut short their breaks, abandon holiday plans entirely, or look overseas for better value.

"This 'Holiday Tax' will hit families hardest, puts jobs at risk, drain money from local businesses and communities and undermine the Government's growth agenda," the letter stated.

The signatories raised particular concerns about coastal areas heavily dependent on tourism for employment. Fewer visitors would translate into reduced shifts and diminished opportunities, especially for entry-level workers and those returning to employment, they argued.

Beyond accommodation providers, the ripple effects would damage restaurants, cafes, pubs, taxi firms and shops that rely on tourist spending to survive.

"In many places, it is tourist spending which keeps high streets alive, supporting the small businesses that define our communities," the letter warned.

The hospitality sector is already grappling with significant financial pressures beyond the proposed levy. Business rates for hotels are set to surge dramatically, with analysis by UKHospitality suggesting average bills will rise by 115 per cent over the coming three years, adding more than £205,000 to typical costs.

While pubs secured a 15 per cent discount on their business rates following industry outcry last month, hotels and other accommodation providers were excluded from the relief measures.

Rising energy costs, increased employment expenses and higher National Insurance contributions have compounded the sector's difficulties.

The letter noted that UK hospitality already pays VAT at 20 per cent, double the rate charged by competitors in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

A Government spokesman defended the plans, stating: "We expect any new charges to be modest and in line with other countries, and it is for mayors to consider the right level for their area."

Text: Plans to make migrants wait longer to get the right to live in the UK permanently should not apply to people already in the country, Labour MPs have said.

A letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, signed by 35 Labour MPs, along with 17 from other parties, 21 peers and 33 civil society organisations, says the proposals are "unfair towards migrant workers who have put down roots, contributed to their communities and built lives here".

Ministers want to double the time it takes for most migrants to qualify for permanent residence from five to 10 years.

Mahmood has defended the plans, saying the "unprecedented" number of people arriving in the UK demands an answer from the government.


The government's proposed changes would extend the standard wait to qualify for settlement to 10 years.

Migrants will be able to shorten this period, for example if they are a high earner, while other groups would see a longer wait.

People who arrived on health and social care visas would face a 15-year wait, while those who relied on benefits for more than 12 months would have to wait 20 years.

The changes would not apply to people who have already obtained settlement but would cover people already living in the UK, including those who had been expecting to get permanent residence in the coming months.

The government has said migrants who come to the UK must contribute to earn their right to stay, arguing the scale of migration is placing pressure on local communities.

However, Labour MPs opposed to the plans have branded the retrospective approach "un-British" and "moving the goalposts".

The letter, which is also signed by Andrea Egan, the new head of the UK's biggest trade union Unison, says: "The British public believe in fair play: that if you work hard, follow the rules and contribute, that government should tread lightly on your life."

It adds: "The proposals to change settlement rules would pull the rug from under migrant workers, including in social care who provide dignity and comfort to our loved ones, often in difficult conditions and for low pay.

"The government must uphold its promises - we cannot simply change the rules halfway through an agreed process."

The letter warns there are already thousands of vacancies in social care and the proposals "risk pushing the sector closer to breaking point".

It calls on the government to "immediately rule out applying new immigration rules to migrant families already in the UK" and for a consultation process on the proposals, which closes at the end of Thursday,  to be halted until a full impact assessment is published.

Labour MPs who have signed the letter are mostly on the left of the party and it was coordinated by Neil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole who has called for the prime minister to resign over the Lord Mandelson scandal.

Other signatories include Alex Sobel, a leading member of the centre-left Mainstream group, former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Rachael Maskell, who led a rebellion against benefit cuts last year.

Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru Westminster Leader Liz Saville Roberts and all four Green Party MPs are also among those who signed the letter.

Concern over the plans among Labour MPs has been growing, with around 40 criticising the proposals in a recent debate in Parliament.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Angola have said they will cooperate on migrant returns.

Around 40 Labour MPs have raised concerns about the impact of the government's proposals.

The home secretary says there are "practical issues" around how quickly people can be detained.

Civil liberties campaigners are among those to raise concerns over the increase in live facial recognition vans.

The Home Secretary has announced plans to cut the number of forces in England and Wales.

Text: Tesco intends to make its Clubcard available to under-18s this year, the supermarket said.

Its loyalty scheme allows shoppers to get discounts on thousands of products, including its popular meal deals, and collect points which can be turned into vouchers.

The supermarket did not say why it has decided to widen eligibility to younger customers, or elaborate on how this might work.

It follows campaigning from Which? urging supermarkets to lift what it called "unfair restrictions" on who can access loyalty schemes.

The UK's competition regulator has said that, while supermarkets' eligibility requirements are unlikely to breach consumer law, some could do more to broaden access, including allowing under-18s to benefit from schemes.

Loyalty cards are a way for retailers to collect data on what customers are buying and offer them more at lower prices. It allows them to compete for customers as rising food prices squeeze margins.

The average person has loyalty cards for three supermarkets, data from research firm Kantar suggests.

Most of the biggest UK supermarkets require shoppers to be 18 or over to sign up for their rewards schemes.

Some, such as Morrisons, allow younger customers to log into their parent or guardian's account to access discounted prices.

The Co-op says those aged 16 and over can sign up for its loyalty scheme, while younger customers can become a junior member if their parent or guardian purchases and registers a temporary card for them.

A Tesco spokesperson said: "We are actively reviewing Tesco Clubcard with the intention of making Clubcard available to under-18s this year.

"Those customers who do not have a Clubcard can still get great value from Tesco due to our combination of Aldi Price Match and Everyday Low Prices."

Which? said millions of customers are excluded from getting discounts at big retailers because of age, address and digital access requirements.

The consumer outlet, which has just released its annual customer satisfaction survey, said Tesco had twice missed out on being awarded "Recommended Provider" status because its Clubcard discounts were not available to everyone.

Reena Sewraz, Which? retail editor, said Tesco's Clubcard savings can be "really significant, which is why access to them matters so much for shoppers trying to make ends meet".

She added: 'We're glad Tesco has listened – this is a big step in the right direction, provided it moves quickly to fully implement these changes."

Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of the Grocer, told the BBC he expects other supermarkets to take similar steps.

"When Tesco moves others follow. It's not the first loyalty card to become available to younger people but it's the biggest, and if it's okay by Tesco others will find a way," he said.

Asked why most big UK supermarkets don't already allow under-18s to sign up to these schemes, he said there had been concerns about data protection for minors.

But he added that if people younger than this can hold bank accounts, access social media and the internet, drive a car and get married, "they should also be able to buy food for themselves and those they may care for, at the most competitive prices".

Scott Warner will return to prison six years after he was jailed for helping a killer evade police.

          Kelvin Mackenzie,


Updated: 12/02/2026

Unfortunately, the 73-year-old is too clever to be a politician, writes the former editor of The Sun

Let’s be honest, the nation needs a lot more Jim Ratcliffes and rather less Keir Starmers. Look at the two men. Sir Jim was raised in a council house not far from Oldham, yet went on to make billions through the chemical business, investing a decent chunk of it in Manchester United.

By buying into Man U, he wanted to support his boyhood club. I recall once chatting with Sir John Majedski, the man who founded Auto Trader and later went on to rescue Reading Football Club.

I asked him why he had put all that money in. He replied: ‘’I wanted to put something back. I didn’t realise I was going to put it all back.’’

Good gag.

Starmer too went to a grammar school, made his money as a human rights lawyer, but spent most of his political career banging on about being working class. Ratcliffe never did that.

With his alleged ‘’forensic mind’’ I find it odd that Starmer believed Mandelson and Doyle when they denied their links to a paedophile.

Perhaps he’s just plain thick. Looking at their CVs, it’s clear that if you should listen to one of the men, it must be Ratcliffe.

He has angered Starmer by saying what many accept: Britain has been ‘’colonised’’ by immigrants who are ‘’costing too much money’’.

Further, he said the country needed a leader ‘’prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out’’.

Starmer is unpopular (actually the most unpopular PM in history), but it’s clear he can’t sort anything out. In fact, he’s made our country a lot worse. In response to Ratcliffe, he said that the UK is a ‘’proud, tolerant and diverse country’’.

Rather than being proud, we should be ashamed that we have changed the diversity of our country without ever putting the question to the people.

Our lost nation needs a lot more Jim Ratcliffes and rather fewer Keir Starmers — Kelvin MacKenzie


The reason that Blair and Brown, the instigators of the policy, never asked is that they wouldn’t like the answer.

I note that a number of Labour MPs have pointed out that through his shareholding of Manchester United, Ratcliffe actually runs the club with a number of his playing squad immigrants.

Surely, they are the kind of migrants the nation needs. They are highly skilled, are given a time-limited contract, earn good money, pay good taxes and at the end of their time head back to their homelands. The other swipe they take at Ratcliffe is that he lives in the tax haven of Monaco.

I should point out that he and his company will have paid more taxes to the Exchequer in his time than all his critics put together.

Certainly, a damn site more taxes than Starmer has ever paid. And to be honest, if I had been as successful as Ratcliffe, I wouldn’t hang around the UK for two minutes to see how Starmer and his chums from PaedosRUS are planning to spend my money.

Unfortunately, Ratcliffe, 73, is too clever to be a politician, which is a shame as my bet is that he would skate home (with a triple axel) as Prime Minister.

His thoughts are aligned with the majority of the country. He would beat a Starmer figure in an election hands down. I trust he doesn’t stop him from saying what he believes simply because an unpopular Labour leader comes out against him. Surprised we haven’t heard from Gary Neville yet.

If Ratcliffe were to go quiet, we would only ever hear Starmer’s thoughts. And I think we can all agree he’s a dud. More’s the pity.
