Ranjana Jha, in her complaint to the police, said that she was married to Udit Narayan Jha on December 7, 1984 under Hindu rituals. File

Bollywood singer Udit Narayan Jha found himself in a controversy on Thursday (February 12, 2026) after his first wife, Ranjana Jha, recently filed a complaint at a women’s police station in the Supaul district of north Bihar. She levelled charges that her uterus was removed without her consent during an operation in 1996 in Delhi by her husband, Udit Narayan Jha, and his two brothers.

Ranjana Jha, in her complaint to the police, said that she was married to Udit Narayan Jha on December 7, 1984 under Hindu rituals.

Accompanied by her lawyer, Karunakant Jha, Ranjana Jha, 61, the daughter of Chandrakant Jha, approached the women’s police station in the Supaul district of north Bihar, where she has been a resident, on Tuesday (February 10, 2026).  She further claimed that she became aware of the operation years later, during a medical consultation.

According to her, Udit Narayan Jha moved to Mumbai in 1985 to pursue his singing career in Bollywood. However, she later learned through media reports that he had married another woman, Deepa Narayan. Every time he was questioned about this, he “kept misleading her.”

In 1996, under the pretext of medical treatment, Ranjana Jha claimed that Udit Narayan Jha and his two brothers, Sanjay Kumar Jha and Lalit Narayan Jha, took her to a large hospital in Delhi, where her uterus was surgically removed without her consent.

In 2006, she claimed that she was verbally abused and denied entry into Udit Narayan Jha’s residence in Mumbai. Later, she received the same treatment when she visited her in-laws’ house in Nepal. “Since then, I’ve been compelled to live at my parental home in Supaul,” she alleged in her complaint to the Supaul police.

She further said that she had also filed cases in the Family Court in Supaul and approached the Women’s Commission. Udit Narayan Jha, she claimed, has “accepted” her as his wife in writing during proceedings and has also submitted a compromise petition. “But I have received neither respect nor any kind of support from my husband, Udit Narayan Jha or his family since then. I want justice,” she alleged.

“Whatever charges Ranjana Jha has levelled are under investigation and an FIR will be registered on her complaint based on the findings that emerge in the investigation. The incidents mentioned in her complaint are around 30 years old,” the women police station in-charge, Anju Tiwari, told media persons.

Text: Sixteen years after the German Bakery bomb blast in Pune, the trial against alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) terror operative Mohammed Ahmed Zarar Siddibappa alias Yasin Bhatkal (43), one of the key accused in this case, is still on before a special court in Pune.

A high intensity bomb blast at the German Bakery in Koregaon Park area of Pune city, left 17 persons dead and 56 others injured, on the evening of February 13, 2010. In his confession recorded before a court in Kukatpally (in Telangana) in October 2013, Yasin mentioned his role in the German Bakery blast.

As per the confession statement, Yasin hails from Bhatkal in Karnataka. His father, while doing garments and shoes business in Dubai, visited Bhatkal once in three months.

It is stated that Yasin, religious since childhood, failed in SSCL (Class 10 board exams). Initially, he started a business of “garments (Lungi)” in Mumbai in 2001, but within four months, shifted to Bhatkal, where he sold perfumes for about three years.

Some college students like Fasih Mahmood (who later allegedly became an IM operative) often visited Yasin’s perfume shop. Lectures and discussions on jihad and communal violence, were held at the shop, police said.

Between 2004 and 2006, Yasin went to Dubai for a “job in construction” and a business in sports goods. As per Yasin’s confession, around 2004, he met IM founders Riyaz Bhatkal and Iqbal Bhatkal in Mumbai. Yasin did “Jadi Bhooti” business with Bhatkal brothers. Yasin stated how he once admonished Iqbal for buying a motorcycle on a bank loan, as it was against Islam.

As per Riyaz’s instructions, Yasin went to Pakistan in December 2005 for a training of about 50 days in firearms and explosives like TNT (Trinitrotoluene) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Then he went to Dubai, where he started a “personality training educational institute”, it is stated.

Investigators believe that IM was founded around this period. About his association with IM, Yasin stated that he joined an “Usaba”, headed by Iqbal Bhatkal. “Usaba means a group of men who are more than 11 and less than 40… the said Usaba (congregation) is an Arabic word and established in 2005. The main object of Usaba is to collect the persons having the same mentality and dedication to do something.” he stated.

Yasin returned to India from Dubai in 2007. He stayed at a farmhouse in Koppa in Karnataka for a year, when Riyaz asked him to experiment with a “bomb”.

In his confession, Yasin stated how during March 2008, he prepared “Claymore IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) getting inspired by a Hollywood movie. Yasin also stated how the IM members took a house on rent in Pune, kept changing their locations, while IEDs prepared by him were used for various terror attacks in the country, before his arrest from the India- Nepal border in Bihar, on August 28, 2013

Previously, the Kolkata police had arrested Yasin in December 2009 in an arms dealing case. Yasin stated that after coming out of jail, he along with Qateel Siddiqui and others wanted to take revenge. “Accordingly we blasted German Bakery, Pune on 31.2.2010,” he stated.

The Maharashtra ATS arrested Yasin in German Bakery case on March 14, 2014 and filed a chargesheet against him in August same year. Investigators believe that Yasin is visible in the CCTV footage of the blast day obtained from the German bakery premises during the probe. The trial against Yasin is on before a special court in Pune court.

A special NIA court awarded death sentence to Yasin, along with IM member Ajaz Shaikh, a BPO staffer from Pune, for Hyderabad twin blasts on February 21, 2013. The court order stated that Ajaz had allegedly delivered the explosives for bombing the German Bakery to Yasin. But the ATS probe made no mention of Ajaz.

A Delhi police probe into the arrest of alleged IM operative Qateel Siddiqui in November 2011, revealed he conducted a recce of the German Bakery along with Yasin. The ATS had later arrested Siddiqui for his alleged plan to bomb the Dagdusheth Ganpati temple on February 13, 2010, same day when German Bakery was attacked. However, Siddqui was murdered by Pune gangster Sharad Mohol at the Yerwada jail in June 2012. Mohol was shot dead by a gang member in January 2024.

The ATS probe

The ATS had filed a charge sheet against seven persons – Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Bhatkal, Yasin Bhatkal, Mohsin Choudhari of IM and alleged Lashkar E Taiba (LeT) operatives Himayat Baig. Fayyaz Kagzi, Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal of Beed district, in German Bakery case.

On April 18, 2013, a Pune court granted death penalty to Baig, who was arrested by the ATS in September 2010. In May 2016, the Bombay High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. But, Yasin’s confession says nothing about Baig.

Jundal, alleged to be involved in 26/11 Mumbai attack, was deported from Saudi Arabia to India on June 25, 2012. He has not yet been arrested in the German Bakery case. Riyaz, Iqbal and Mohsin, a Pune resident, are absconding. Fayyaz Kagzi is known to have blown himself up outside the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 4, 2016.

Text: When Anthony Mosca dug out a yorker-length ball from Dipendra Singh Airee in the 13th over and ran through for the single that sealed it, he flung both arms into the Mumbai sky. A roar followed. At the other end, his brother Justin waited. The embrace was instant. Tears soon followed.

Italy had just silenced a sizable Nepalese-heavy crowd and created history – a 10-wicket win over Nepal in their Group C clash, and their first-ever victory at a World Cup. The margin was emphatic. The performance, clinical. And at its heart were three men who scripted an evening few in Italian cricket will forget.

Chasing 124, the Mosca brothers made the target look trivial, racing home in just 12.4 overs. Justin, three years younger and a physical education teacher by profession, set the tone. The powerplay was carnage – 50 runs in four overs as he tore into Nepal’s seamers and spinners alike, unfurling drives, pulls and lofted hits with fearless intent.

Justin, who grew up in Sydney alongside Anthony, never harboured ambitions of turning professional.

“I never really had aspirations to play professional cricket in Australia. I studied for a teaching degree and was at university, so it was hard to pursue cricket. I love cricket for the competitive side of it and the team aspect, which is why I love playing with these boys so much,” he had told The Indian Express.

On Thursday, with Italy’s tournament hanging in the balance, he produced perhaps the finest innings of his life as the evening sun dipped over Mumbai.

At the other end stood Anthony, a carpenter and a builder for 12 years, matching his brother stroke for stroke. The sixes flowed on both sides of the wicket. Nepal’s bowlers searched for control but found none. Italy were 68/0 after six overs, the contest effectively decided.

“There were definitely a few tears in the boys’ eyes. It meant a lot, especially for the two Mosca brothers – chasing down 100 together was phenomenal. We were also outstanding in the field. In our first game, nothing went our way. Today, everything did. But that was because we played brave cricket instead of being tentative like we were in our first World Cup match (against Scotland). Seeing AJ Mosca in tears shows what this means. You don’t often see players crying after a group-stage win – but that’s the passion Italians bring,” stand-in captain Harry Manenti said at the post-match presentation.

Both brothers reached their half-centuries in the 11th over. Rohit Paudel shuffled through his spin options, probing for a breakthrough, but there was no opening. The pair remained unbeaten – Anthony on 62, Justin on 60 – as Italy romped home with 44 balls to spare.

If the Moscas finished the job with the bat, Crishan Kalugamage set it up with the ball. On most Sundays, the 34-year-old is shaping dough in a pizzeria in Lucca, juggling orders during one of Tuscany’s busiest shifts. On Thursday, he shaped something far bigger – Nepal’s innings.

The Sri Lanka-born leg-spinner, who moved to Italy with his parents in 2007, returned figures of 3/18 in four overs. These were not token wickets at the death. Rohit Paudel, Dipendra Singh Airee and Gulshan Jha all fell to his variations, each dismissal tightening Italy’s grip.

His journey has been anything but straightforward.

“I lost a lot of jobs. Sunday is a very busy day, lots of bosses aren’t keen on you not working because you are playing cricket,” he had told the BBC, outlining the sacrifices required to pursue cricket in a country where the sport barely registers.

There were reinventions along the way. Once a fast bowler, recurring injuries forced him to re-assess. The switch proved transformative. Since joining Roma Cricket Club in 2015-16 and breaking into the national side in 2022, Kalugamage has evolved into a control bowler. Ahead of the World Cup, he even spent time as a net bowler with Sri Lanka, gleaning advice from Wanindu Hasaranga – one of the leg-spinners he admires, alongside Shane Warne and Rashid Khan.

Under the afternoon sun in Mumbai, Tuscany’s pizzaiolo delivered spin with bite. By the time the Mosca brothers walked out, the hard work had been done. Italy did the rest – and made history.

Brief Scores: Nepal 123 all out in 19.3 overs (Aarif Sheikh 27; Crishan Kalugamage 3/18) lost to Italy 124/0 in 12.4 overs (Anthony Mosca 62*, Justin Mosca 60*) by 10 wickets.

File image of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk. 

The Supreme Court on Thursday (February 12, 2026) asked the Centre if climate activist Sonam Wangchuk was able to see, on his part, four videos the authorities are citing, among other clips, to justify his detention under the National Security Act (NSA).

Appearing before a Bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P.B. Varale, Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj said the authorities banked on 23 videos to order detention, and everything was supplied to Mr. Wangchuk.

However, the activist’s lawyers maintained four videos were not in the pen drive given to Mr. Wangchuk and that he has repeatedly sought the videos from the authorities.

During the hearing, Mr. Nataraj submitted that the detention had prevented the violence from escalating in a sensitive border area.

On February 11, the court had pointed to phrases in statements made by Mr. Wangchuk expressing his anxiety about departing from the Gandhian, non-violent mode of struggle. The Centre had strongly objected to the court associating Mr. Wangchuk, whom the government counsel described as a person “completely anti-India”, with Mahatma Gandhi.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Mr. Nataraj had disagreed with the court’s earlier proposal to relook the detention order on medical grounds. Mr. Mehta said Mr. Wangchuk’s “health facade was manufactured and synthetic”.

The activist has been detained in Jodhpur Central Jail for nearly five months since September 26 last year, two days after violent protests demanding Statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh left four people dead and several injured in the Union Territory.

Text: As Italian cricket president Simone Gambino shed tears after his team’s 10 wicket win over Nepal, their first ever in a World Cup, he had an old friend for company. It was Indias renowned actor Kabir Bedi, talking to the team in Italian.

Gambino recalled how when he asked around if everyday Italians knew the great ‘Tendu luca’ (Sachin Tendulkar) he was met with a constant response – in Italy they only knew Kabir Bedi.

Bedi had famously starred in an Italian 1976 miniseries called ‘Sandokan’ about a rebelling pirate fighting against British colonialism. Gambino recalled, “In Italy they only know you. The Malaysian Tiger (main character) Kabir Bedi.”

Gambino recalled how 50 years ago, people would laugh at him when they heard he played cricket. “I would’ve never imagined this moment. But now we are going right back to Kolkata to shoot down England. We want to be in semis,” he said in an official video released by the Italian cricket team on Instagram.

The Italian celebration involved singing off their travelling banner while stomping their feet and banging their bats into the Wankhede dressing room floor with a piercing warcry.

La Maglia… azzurra

(The shirt…blue)

Siamo pronti. Alla morte

(We are ready. For death ( to die for the team))

Noi siamo. italia

(We are Italy)

Chi siamo. Italia

(Who are we? Italy)

Earlier in the leadup to the World Cup Christian ‘Bobo’ Vieri had put out a message telling Italians that cricket was a fine game, recalling an Aus vs West Indies match he saw as a child. “Viv Richards. Joel Garner. Malcolm Marshall. They are fenomena (phenomenons). I know not many Italians know cricket. But I am here and I know things,” he would declare before wishing his team.
