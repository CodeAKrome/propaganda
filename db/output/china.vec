Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on China's political purge of military leaders on 'Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: A bipartisan group of senior U.S. lawmakers is urging Taiwan to dramatically boost its defense spending, warning that political gridlock in Taipei risks undermining deterrence as China escalates military pressure around the island.

Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Chris Coons, D-Del., along with Reps. Young Kim, R-Calif., and Ami Bera, D-Calif., sent a letter from 37 lawmakers on Thursday to leaders of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan expressing "serious concerns" that a proposed special defense budget could be only partially funded.

"We hope you will support a robust, multiyear special defense budget… that adequately meet(s) the moment and send(s) a clear signal of Taiwan’s will to defend itself," the lawmakers wrote.

The warning comes as Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, pushes for a major multiyear $40 billion defense package aimed at strengthening the island’s asymmetric warfare capabilities — including missiles, air defense systems, drones and reserve force training — designed to make any Chinese invasion or blockade far more costly.

But the proposal has become entangled in a fierce domestic political battle.

Opposition parties that control Taiwan’s legislature have resisted fully approving the special defense budget, arguing for revisions and greater oversight. The standoff has fueled concern in Washington that delays could weaken Taiwan’s readiness at a time when Beijing is intensifying military operations near the island.

Lai warned in a news conference Wednesday that the opposition's refusal to advance the budget "risks causing the international community to question Taiwan's resolve to defend itself."

Opposition lawmakers have advanced a significantly smaller counterproposal that strips out several capabilities defense officials consider essential to deterring a Chinese attack.

The revised plan would cut President Lai Ching-te’s proposed eight-year special defense budget by nearly 70%, including funding for key U.S. weapons systems, according to Taiwanese officials. Lai has argued that Taiwan cannot afford hesitation as regional tensions grow.

"Today, there is a high degree of international consensus that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are indispensable elements for global security and prosperity," Lai said. "Faced with China's expanding military threats, nations across the Indo-Pacific region are increasing their defense budgets… Taiwan must follow suit."

China's People’s Liberation Army has conducted multiple large-scale exercises around Taiwan in recent months, including drills simulating encirclement and blockade operations. Chinese aircraft routinely cross the median line of the Taiwan Strait and enter Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, while Chinese vessels have increased activity in surrounding waters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping repeatedly has refused to rule out the use of force to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control.

"The threat posed by the People’s Republic of China against Taiwan has never been greater," the U.S. lawmakers wrote, citing growing military pressure and coercive actions designed to "undermine Taiwan’s will to resist."

The letter also acknowledges mounting frustration in Washington over delays in U.S. weapons deliveries to Taiwan, noting that the United States must address its own "massive backlog" of approved arms sales.

"For our part, the U.S. must address the massive backlog in weapons deliveries to Taiwan," the lawmakers wrote. "You have our commitment… to ensure Taiwan gets the capabilities it needs, faster. Likewise, we need Taiwan to step up with us."

Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. is committed to providing Taiwan with defensive weapons but maintains a policy of "strategic ambiguity" over whether American forces would directly intervene in a conflict.

The budget debate in Taipei now carries outsized geopolitical weight.

Supporters of Lai’s proposal argue that failing to fund the full package could send the wrong signal to Beijing about Taiwan’s resolve. Critics counter that defense spending must be carefully scrutinized and balanced against domestic priorities.

As China continues high-profile military drills around the island, U.S. lawmakers are making clear they believe the moment demands urgency.


"Both the United States and Taiwan must do more to deter PRC aggression," the letter states.

Whether Taiwan’s divided legislature ultimately delivers the funding Lai is seeking could shape not only cross-strait tensions, but Washington’s confidence in the island’s long-term defense posture.

Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture, the Fisheries Agency said early Friday.

The incident in the waters off southwestern Japan marks the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat, coming at a time when diplomatic relations between Japan and China have remained strained for months under the leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Zheng Nianli, the 47-year-old Chinese skipper of the fishing boat, was arrested Thursday and stands accused of trying to evade an onboard inspection by a Japanese fisheries control officer about 170 kilometers southwest of the island of Meshima in Goto, Nagasaki.

According to the agency's regional office, the vessel had a crew of 11 and is described as a "tiger net fishing boat," usually known for catching fish such as mackerel and horse mackerel.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a regular press conference on Friday in Tokyo that while an investigation into the case continues, the Japanese government will act "resolutely" through enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal operations by foreign fishing vessels.

The Chinese fishing boat is also the first foreign fishing boat seized by the Japanese Fisheries Agency this year.

The agency conducts onboard inspections and other operations to combat illegal fishing in Japanese waters. Last year, it seized two foreign fishing vessels -- one Taiwanese and one South Korean.

According to its annual report, in 2024 the agency conducted seven onboard inspections, seized a Taiwanese fishing boat and confiscated illegal fishing gear in 18 cases.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

Fishing disputes are one place where Japan can lay down the law without too much blowback. But the ownership of Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is a much more volatile matter that must be handled carefully in order not to push the two countries into a stand-off that neither can back away from.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Hahahaha

In the September 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with a Japan Coast Guard patrol vessel off the coast of the Senkaku Islands (Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture), the Naha District Public Prosecutors Office's decision to release the arrested Chinese captain without further action was reportedly cited as "protecting the Senkaku Islands from China."

In a case where the administration was cozying up to China, then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan and others in the Prime Minister's Office reportedly conveyed their desire to "release" the captain. Former Foreign Minister and House of Representatives member Seiji Maehara also stated that the release was "an instruction from Prime Minister Kan."

It is unusual for prosecutors, who base their work on "law and evidence," to take political factors into consideration, but a prosecutor familiar with the situation at the time said, "The administration lacked the information, equipment, and resolve to protect the Senkaku Islands, and public opinion had not been sufficiently cultivated. Considering the national interest, they could not abandon important territory for the sake of judicial appearances."

Such an approach is unlikely to be taken under the Takaichi administration.

Chinese netizens would be asking for war with Japan now even harder, of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel.  what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

And as my user name says, "NO SUSHI FOR YOU!"

Those were the last words the illegal Chinese captain/fisherman heard from the Japanese Coast Guard after he was detained.

Skip a few episodes. China will leverage rare earths. There’s little Japan can do but that’s for when the wheels come off.

Recently, Japanese media announced with great fanfare the discovery of 16 million tons of rare earth minerals in waters near Minami-Torishima Island, approximately 2,000 kilometers from the mainland, claiming it ranks third globally in reserves.

This so-called "major discovery" was first reported by Japanese media back in 2012, with headlines even more sensational than today's. By 2018, Japan had recycled the same story once again, claiming the rare earths discovered could supply global demand for hundreds of years. Now in 2026, the news has resurfaced yet again, using virtually identical wording from eight years ago.

So no Japan has no rare earths it processes commercially and it would be foolish to replay 2012 with today’s China. Best to get along with your neighbors.

of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

I think there’s some confusion here, so let me clarify a few points.

Okinawa was historically part of the Ryukyu Kingdom, known in  Chinese sources in the Ming as 小琉球國, while Taiwan was referred to as 大琉球國 during parts of the Ming period. The Ryukyu Kingdom had its own distinct political status and tributary relationships, and Taiwan’s status also changed over time, including its annexation by the Qing.

However, Okinawa has not historically been claimed as Chinese territory in the way you’re suggesting. an d neither had Kyushu.

Equating historical naming conventions or tributary ties with formal territorial claims is misleading.

If we’re going to discuss history, we should at least be accurate about the distinctions between tribute relationships, naming, and sovereignty. We should also be honest about claims made by net citizens.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

It was learned on February 6th that after Chinese authorities tightened export controls on dual-use items to Japan in January, they have now approved multiple exports of rare earths to Japan.

China appears to be wary of Japan, the US, and Europe accelerating their efforts to reduce their dependence on China for rare earth procurement.

China should not give in to trivial matters and should stick to its strong policy of banning exports to Japan.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The rule of law being enforced on the high seas. The Chinese fishing boat militia will hate it and go into another meltdown. Just keep watching the behavior guys. Zero need for politics whatsoever when it comes to this stuff.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

spoke too soon about the politics. Our friend Agent Neo deciding to give us this lovely tidbit of timely ‘information’ when it comes to the concept of sea zones and Japans sovereign waters. Just throw it out there like a net and see what swims in.

So the narrative is this. Remember this is after an incident of a ‘fisherman’ being arrested due to IGNORING messages and warnings that he had entered Japans waters illegally.

Don’t like that? Just double down.

Go straight to deny Japans own waters, by suggesting matter of factly that Okinawa now may not be part of Japan after all. They have kindly rewritten history to suit their own agenda. Such a service, the education factor.

Then tying Japan to their nemesis the U.S and rare Earths too as another effort to justify their actions and behaviors, and hopefully net some sympathy with the self hating subsection of our countries. No need to even say which ones at this point either. I’m sure y’all can take a wild guess.

Agent Neo thanks for the insight, love the name too.

What is the Matrix?

The matrix is control.

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

and Guru. Just perfect mate. Marvelously you. Norway and Australia the aggressors. Gurus an Aussie btw folks. Go figure that one out.

Am home in Perth by the way fella! Paradise!

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The people in Taiwan are not an independent ethnic group. They are the Han people who crossed the Straights from mainland China, and they share the same ancestors.

Your conclusion is?

check the ship's bridge and study the equipment and search the compartments, I'm going to bet that this might be a ship under the maritime militia, a paramilitary force under the chinese navy. If not, it's still a good move to do so. But, I can imagine after Takaichi's landslide victory, the Cancel Culture Party's emotional fuse is running short as of late. This incident might just be what's needed to give them another hissy fit.

Good on you, Japan.

Is there any need to ask obvious questions about Taiwan?

It has long been inhabited by Austronesian indigenous people.

In the 16th century, the Portuguese called it "Formosa" (Beautiful Island).

If the indigenous people of Taiwan were of mainland Chinese descent, I wouldn't have any complaints.

But that's not the case.

It began as an island of indigenous people, then passed through the Dutch and Spanish colonial period in the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty, Japan's rule for about 50 years (1895-1945), and finally arrived at the present day Republic of China.

Since it was a colony of the Netherlands, Spain, and Japan, would the Chinese Communist Party recognize any country that claimed it?

Just because Okinawa paid tribute to China doesn't mean it's Chinese territory, of course. Japan also paid tribute to China until the Tang Dynasty.

And unlike Taiwan, Okinawa has never been Chinese territory.

The Senkaku Islands also became an issue after undersea resources were discovered in the 1970s.

Until then, the Chinese Communist Party also treated them as Japanese territory...

The Matrix is ​​"virtual reality." Thanks.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel. what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

Vessels of any nation operating in another nation’s EEZ are subject to boarding, arrest, and seizure.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Water cannons are actually the more extreme response, as smaller vessels, especially those without sealed decks can quickly become waterlogged and sunk.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Not true. Firstly, it's the Coast Guard of the FSB Border Service of Russia.

Secondly, there was one shooting of a crab poacher, clearly in Russian waters, in 2006 after a ramming incident. The previous one before that was way back in 1956, so not "regularly" by any measure. Sensible to apply for a permit.

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

"Chinese won't stay calm"? It's a fishing boat, not a declaration of war. Maybe they should try staying within their own borders instead of worrying about their "calmness" after getting caught red-handed.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

"Economic sanctions and military response" for catching a poacher? That isn’t diplomacy; that’s a temper tantrum.

If the "Chinese people" feel insulted by Japan enforcing its own maritime borders, the problem isn't the arrest—it’s the entitlement. Expecting a sovereign nation to ignore illegal incursions just to soothe your ego is peak arrogance.

Real respect is earned by following international law, not by sending fishing fleets to scavenge in waters that don't belong to you and then playing the victim when you get caught. If you want to avoid "insults," tell your skippers to stay in their own lane.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has ⁠shelved a number of key tech security measures aimed at Beijing ahead of an April meeting between the two countries' presidents. The measures include a ban on China Telecom's U.S. operations and restrictions on sales of Chinese equipment for U.S. data centers, sources said.

The U.S. has also put on hold proposed bans on domestic sales of routers made by TP-Link and the U.S. internet business of China Unicom and China Mobile along with another measure that would bar sales of Chinese electric trucks and buses in the U.S., four people said, declining to be named.

Those decisions have not previously been reported. They are the latest moves by the Trump administration to ​rein in U.S. government actions that could antagonize Beijing following a trade truce reached by China’s Xi Jinping and Trump in October, the sources said.

U.S. allies in NATO said Thursday they believed the crisis over Greenland had passed after the launch of a mission in the Arctic -- and looked to press on with bolstering Europe's role in the alliance.

President Donald Trump's threats against Denmark's autonomous Arctic territory last month plunged the 76-year-old transatlantic alliance into its deepest crisis in years, before he abruptly backed off.

As part of a package to assuage Trump -- who said the U.S. needed to secure the region against a threat from Russia and China -- NATO announced Wednesday the start of an Arctic Sentry mission to increase security in the region.

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said he was "fully confident that this will also meet the concerns of the United States" at a meeting with counterparts from the 32-nation alliance in Brussels.

But while Europe breathed a sigh of relief about the apparent passing of that storm, the Greenland crisis has only reinforced for many the urgent need for Europe to take a greater role in NATO and its own defence in the face of the threat from Russia.

"What I see today is this mindset shift, where people understand that, yes, it is about spending more, but also it is about a duty of vision that we have to do this together with the United States," said NATO boss Mark Rutte.

That is the message being sent by the Trump administration as well: that Europe needs to step up as Washington pivots to focus on other challenges such as China.

U.S. defense under secretary Elbridge Colby said allies were making strides towards a situation where it is "Europe that leads the conventional defense of NATO" rather than traditionally relying on U.S. military might.

And he said Washington would "continue to press, respectfully but firmly and insistently, for a rebalancing of roles and burdens within the Alliance".

"If Europe rises to this moment," he said, "the alliance will emerge stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the challenges ahead," Colby told allies at NATO's Brussels headquarters.

To make good on plans for Europe to play a bigger role, NATO needs to make strides on fulfilling the pledge made at its summit last year for countries to massively ramp up defense spending.

Military budgets have already increased since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Trump has spurred on that trend.

"The good news is that the billions are coming in," Rutte said.

He insisted however that he believed the United States would continue to play a central role in defending Europe.

"I predict that longer term, you will see, of course, the nuclear umbrella as the ultimate guarantor of our security here in Europe and Canada, but also a strong conventional presence of the U.S. here in Europe," he said.

In a concrete sign of Europe taking more responsibility within NATO, the alliance this week announced the United States was handing two senior regional command positions to Britain and Italy.

The move was heralded by diplomats as a sign of increased "burden-sharing" within the alliance in action.

French Defense Minister Catherine Vautrin referred to a demand several months back from Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that Europeans must be able to ensure their own security.

"Well, we are going to do it, we have started to do it," she said.

The next crucial staging post will be the NATO summit in Ankara in July when allies will have to convince Trump that they are already doing enough.

"We'll receive our first full report on allied defence spending," the NATO US ambassador Matthew Whitaker said this week.

"We still have some allies that need to step up, particularly those geographically further from NATO's eastern flank. They're not moving as fast as they should, and we really expect them to do more."




It's more like they are going independent from the US despite the fact that the US needs allies to deal with China.

While Trump remains in office Europe most certainly must control and lead NATO.

Definitely a dysfunctional alliance.

Euro bloc satellite economies are stagnant and in decline, so many internal issues. Will be funny to watch their impending comedy of errors.

It's more like they are going independent from the US despite the fact that the US needs allies to deal with China.

It really depends on a few factors

Text: Peter Schweizer’s new book, The Invisible Coup: How American Elites and Foreign Powers Use Migration as a Weapon, has been the number one New York Times bestseller in hardcover nonfiction for three weeks straight.

The Times February 22 listing shows the Breitbart News senior contributor’s book has been in the top spot for the past three weeks.

In a social media post on Wednesday afternoon, Schweizer said, “The Invisible Coup’ NYT #1 bestseller….3 weeks in row! Thank you everyone!”

The title debuted at number one in January, which was the fifth time in a row the author and nonpartisan investigative journalist’s work has done so, according to Breitbart News.

“Schweizer, who is a Breitbart Senior Contributor and the President of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI), spent two years with a team of GAI forensic investigators retracing money flows using ‘a trove of confidential documents and intercepted communications’ to expose how political leaders, global NGOs, and even drug cartels politically weaponize mass migration,” the outlet said.

Prior to the book’s release, it reached the number one spot on Amazon:

During an interview on Steve Bannon’s War Room in January, Schweizer explained the effects of birthright citizenship and how the Chinese government is using it:

And here’s the problem, Steve, our federal government has zero idea of how many children are granted citizenship through this birthright citizenship every year. They don’t keep track of it. They have no idea. When you get a birth certificate in the United States, they don’t list the nationality of the parents, so they have zero idea of how many people have done this. But the Chinese government has looked into this, and Chinese research firms have looked into this. And the numbers are absolutely horrifying. Their belief is that every single year for the past 13 years, every single year, roughly 100,000 Chinese babies have been born in the United States. These babies, by the way, are taken back to China. They are the children of elites, military officers.

They’re all U.S. citizens, but they all go back to China. They’re raised in CCP schools, are raised in that environment. When they turn 18 years old, Steve, they’re going to be able to vote. They’re going to be able to donate to political campaigns. They’re going to be able to apply for government jobs. So this is what I call the Manchurian generation.

Bannon then addressed his listeners and said he hoped the information changed the way they saw the issue.

“I hope you’re rattled, audience. I hope you’re rattled to your core, because this book, if you read it, will rattle you to your core,” he stated.

Text: Washington, DC — Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) highlighted revelations made in Peter Schweizer’s new book, The Invisible Coup: How American Elites and Foreign Powers Use Migration as a Weapon, during a Wednesday Breitbart News policy event.

The January-released New York Times bestselling exposé details how the governments of China and Mexico, among others, have been weaponizing weak American immigration policy to infiltrate and undermine the United States for their own interests.

Speaking with Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle this week, the Montana senator explained that he is “pro-legal immigration” while taking a hardline stance against illegal migrants who hurt the U.S.

“I’ll start by saying I’m pro-immigration. I’m pro-legal immigration. I mean, if we didn’t have people, Elon Musk wouldn’t be here, the president’s wife wouldn’t be here,” Sheehy said. “Like, we want good, smart, hardworking people to come to America and build businesses, build talents. That’s what we’re built on.”

“Unfortunately, that system has been abused on both sides of the coin by people using the system as well as folks in our government to try to transform things in favor of their own priorities,” he noted, referring to the Democrat Party’s push for mass, unfettered immigration.

In The Invisible Coup, Schweizer revealed how masses of Chinese elites have exploited U.S. birthright citizenship policies by engaging in birth tourism before raising their American-born children back in China.

More than one million Chinese with U.S. citizenship who grew up in communist China will soon start voting in American elections, the explosive new book states.

Brushing off left-wing accusations of Republicans being “racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant people,” Sheehy said the party needs to “make sure our messaging is on point” on the faults of mass immigration and birthright citizenship.

“We support people who want to come here, share our values, and help us build this great country to be even greater,” the Montana senator told Boyle, before referring to the infamous Somali-run Quality “Learing” Center in Minnesota

“What we don’t support is bad guys coming here, stealing our money, opening ‘learing’ centers that cost us $30 million a year, opening fake daycares, and actively acting as agents of foreign powers — which is exactly what’s going on,” he said.

Pointing out that birthright citizenship was not included in the U.S. Constitution until the Fourteenth Amendment was added in 1868, Sheehy said it was never supposed to be a “blanket” pass for anyone who happens to be born on American soil.

“Just being born here is not enough. You also have to be subject to the jurisdiction. What does that mean? That means we need to be part of a legally naturalized family unit,” he added.

Text: BEIJING — Xiaomi's electric car venture has succeeded in dethroning Tesla in China, at least in January.

The Xiaomi YU7 SUV ranked first in China by sales last month, with 37,869 units sold, twice as many as Tesla's 16,845 Model Y vehicles, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.

The Model Y, which was the best-selling model in December, plunged to 20th place in January. Among new energy vehicles, it also fell from the first position to seventh over the same period.

The figures include both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles and were published late Thursday by online car sales platform Autohome.

Xiaomi started selling the YU7, its second electric car model, roughly half a year ago in the summer of 2025.

The Chinese company, best known for its smartphones, hasn't been shy about its aim to take on Tesla. Xiaomi launched the car at a starting price that was 10,000 yuan ($1,450) below the Model Y in China. The company claimed the model beat Tesla on key metrics such as driving range on a single battery charge.

Analysts last year predicted the YU7 would take market share from the Model Y, Tesla's best-selling car in China. In December, the Model Y ranked first in monthly sales, ahead of BYD's budget-priced Qin Plus car. Xiaomi's YU7 ranked third.

Monthly sales figures can be volatile. While the YU7 did outsell the Model Y in October, the Xiaomi car did not rank first. Tesla has so far been consistently stronger in sales.

Excluding gasoline-powered cars, Tesla ranked fifth in China sales last year, while Xiaomi placed tenth. For all of 2025, BYD led China's auto market with over 3 million vehicles sold, followed by Geely at 2.6 million, according to China Passenger Car Association data.

The YU7's strong sales in January came despite an overall slowdown in China's electric car market in recent months.

Xiaomi's earlier SU7 sedan has also faced scrutiny following fatal accidents involving driver-assist features and electrically-powered door handles. Beijing has since banned hidden door handles, while automakers have started installing external lights that indicate when driver-assist is in use.

Like most Chinese electric car companies, Xiaomi also plans to expand overseas, including into Europe next year.

Summary



Updated Feb 13, 2026, 04:37 AM

ALDEN BIESEN, Belgium - European Union leaders agreed on Feb 12 on a wide-ranging set of commitments to improve how the bloc’s border-free internal market works so Europe’s businesses can be competitive and survive aggressive economic rivalry from the US and China.

Meeting at a Belgian castle, the leaders, stressing how urgent it was to act, agreed to speed up the completion of a savings and investment union, review merger rules to help create European champions, make it easier for companies to get started and operate, and cut red tape throughout, top EU officials said.

“One Europe one market... this is our ambition,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said, adding that the EU executive would also crack down on additional layers of legislation that member states add when implementing EU decisions.

Also, a preference for the purchase of European goods would be allowed in strategic sectors, Dr von der Leyen told a press conference at the end of the meeting.

The European Commission will present in March a plan on how to proceed with this deepening of the European Union’s single market of 450 million consumers, with the aim for leaders to agree on a concrete timetable.

More specifically, Dr von der Leyen said the EU executive arm would push on with a long delayed capital markets union that would allow to invest more productively some €10 trillion (S$15 trillion) of savings now languishing in bank accounts.

“We agreed that we want to be done with phase one of the Savings and Investment Union, that includes market integration, supervision and securitisation by June,” she said.

If it is impossible to move forward quickly with all 27 EU countries at the same time, the EU would push on with the project in a smaller group of at least nine member states, she said.

European Council chief Antonio Costa, speaking of these decisions to speed up unifying Europe’s single market, said: “I think it’s really a game changer.”

One after the other, EU leaders stressed it was urgent to act.

“We share the same sense of urgency. We have to accelerate. We are shaken by competition, sometimes by unfair competition and tariffs,” French President Emmanuel Macron said.

Many leaders also stressed it was vital the EU acts on high energy prices, with Europe’s industry facing power prices that are more than double those in the US and China.

While no decisions on this were made, the Commission will make proposals on how to proceed at the next EU summit in March.

Meanwhile, Dr von der Leyen defended the EU’s emissions trading system (ETS), saying it has “clear benefits,” after some government leaders called for the system to be revised.

“The emission trading system has clear benefits... The ETS has also elements that if the price for whatever reason is going too high, or the economic circumstances are tough, that you can with the ‘market stability reserve’, modulate the price,” she said. REUTERS

Title: Exclusive — Sen. Tim Sheehy Says U.S. Must Reform Defense Acquisition as China Threat Grows: ‘We Gotta Be Ready’

Text: Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) said at a Breitbart News policy discussion event on Wednesday that while Republicans and Democrats do not agree on much, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle support reforming defense acquisition as the threat of communist China grows.

“We are now aligned that we need to rebuild our Navy. We need to modernize and grow our Air Force, and we need to get our recruiting numbers back up. One of the issues though, with — as we hear about our industrial base — where it’s most acute is our aerospace and defense capabilities. We have the most exquisite gear in the world. We have the best air dominance fighters, we have the best ships, best submarines and all of that. The problem is, our Pentagon acquisition processes have focused on processes over outcomes for too long, and we have not prioritized quantity,” Sheehy told Breitbart’s Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle.

“We’ve always prioritized quality — quality is great. But if we have one A-plus fighter jet, and the enemy has a hundred B-minus fighter jets, eventually the hundred will overwhelm the one,” he added.


Sheehy pointed to reports indicating China builds ships “230 times faster than we do.”

“So, for every one ship we build, they build 230. By the way, our Navy is about 230 ships…So they can build an entire navy in a year of our Navy. They’re not as good, but that quantity does matter, especially when we have to send our ships 7,000 miles around the world to project force into the AO (Area of Operations) that they’re going to try to deny us from,” he said.

Sheehy said lawmakers want to reduce the “bureaucratic processes” around defense acquisition, and said the “bureaucratic risk” for acquisition, as is, has been “transferred to the war fighters.”

“A lot of people are upset about my efforts here because the people who are process-oriented, the Pentagon, say, ‘We’ve spent years building these processes, you’re screwing it up.’ A lot of the defense industry doesn’t like it because they say, ‘Listen, we built our businesses around these assumptions. You’re changing it.’ And I say, ‘Listen, I get all that, but I have one obligation, and that’s that 19-year-old Lance Corporal who lands on a beach in some island in the Western Pacific,'” he said. “My wife is a Marine. I was a SEAL. My obligation is to that 19-year-old kid who, when he calls in for air support, he better get it. And when we say, ‘Oh, sorry, we’re out of planes, we’re out of bullets, we’re out of bombs,’ that’s unacceptable to me.”

“I hope another big war doesn’t come,” he continued. “We’re going to do everything we can to avoid it. But history says otherwise — at some point in the relatively near future, we may be facing off against— right now, [China is ] the greatest military player in the world as far as quantity…and we gotta be ready.”

Supporters of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party chanting slogans as they celebrate unofficial news of Mr Tarique Rahman's win in his constituency, on Feb 12 in Dhaka.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 05:59 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 06:05 AM

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landmark parliamentary election on Feb 13, a local TV station showed, as ballots were counted in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the troubled South Asian country.

BNP won 151 seats in the 300-member “Jatiya Sangsad”, or House of the Nation, Ekattor TV showed, crossing the halfway mark for a simple majority.

Its main rival, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, had 42 seats. Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman indicated the party was conceding even before BNP touched the halfway number.

Votes were cast on Feb 11 and tens of millions of Bangladeshis turned up for what was the first election since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time prime minister Sheikh Hasina.


Just weeks after a dramatic purge of China’s top general, the CIA is moving to capitalise on any resulting discord with a new public video targeting potential informants in the Chinese military.

The US spy agency on Feb 12 rolled out the video depicting a disillusioned mid-level Chinese military officer, in the latest US step in a campaign to ramp up human intelligence gathering on Washington’s strategic rival.

It follows a similar effort in May 2025 that focused on fictional figures within China’s ruling Communist Party that provided detailed Chinese-language instructions on how to securely contact US intelligence.

A UK child-care worker who filmed himself sexually abusing youngsters at a nursery where he worked and downloaded over 26,000 indecent images of children was jailed for 18 years on Feb 12.

Vincent Chan, 45, who admitted a raft of 56 charges including sexual assault, was described in court as “every parent’s worst nightmare”.

Passing sentence, Judge John Dodd told him he was guilty of an “utterly wicked, perverse and depraved” campaign of sexual abuse.



Ukraine blamed a Russian disinformation campaign on Feb 12 after fake news posted online about its Winter Olympics team, including a story criticising an athlete disqualified for trying to highlight war deaths.

The fake posts, which racked up over a million views across multiple platforms, included a claim about Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, banned from competing on Feb 12 for wearing a helmet with images of athletes killed in the war.

“Russians have rolled out an information campaign to discredit Ukraine,” Kyiv’s Centre for Countering Disinformation said on Feb 12.



Four-time world champion Max Verstappen launched a scathing broadside at the new breed of Formula One cars, describing them as “anti-racing” at the end of the second day of testing in Bahrain on Feb 12.

The Dutchman ran his Red Bull for 136 laps on Feb 11, clocking the second quickest time of the day, before watching new teammate Isack Hadjar take to the track on Feb 12.

But speaking at his first press conference of the year, Verstappen was underwhelmed by this year’s rule changes which have led to a complete overhaul of chassis and engines for every team, with a bigger focus on energy management.

Text: 

The United States is warning Peru that China’s growing control over a major Pacific port could threaten the country’s sovereignty, escalating tensions over Beijing’s expanding footprint in Latin America.

The concern centers on the $1.3 billion deep-water port in Chancay, north of Lima, which has become a flashpoint between Washington and Beijing after a Peruvian court ruling limited government regulatory oversight of the project.

The State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was "concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners," adding: "We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty."

China's foreign ministry rejected the comments as "rumor-mongering and smearing" and insisted the project remains under Peruvian authority, according to The Associated Press report.

Asia analyst Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital: "Chancay is so central that analysts say it will redirect trade across the South Pacific. We know Beijing considers ports to be dual-use and strategic. China, held up the BlackRock deal to acquire the CK Hutchinson port operations in the Panama Canal Zone even though the ports are nowhere near China itself."

"In times of war, China will not allow its port operations to load, unload, or service American ships or ships coming from or going to U.S. ports," he warned.

Jack Burnham, senior analyst in the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the port reflects a broader strategic push by Beijing in the region.

"The Chancay port is a keystone in China’s investment in Latin America — its size and proximity provide a bridge across the Pacific and access to another market to fuel Beijing’s export-driven economic engine," Burnham said.

"China’s investment in Peru is predicated on Beijing grasping the sinews of Lima’s critical infrastructure to gain influence. With effective control over the port cemented for now by a lower Peruvian court ruling, China gains access to one of the largest critical infrastructure projects in the region, a position from which it could exercise significant control."

The dispute comes as Washington and Beijing compete for influence across Latin America, where China has expanded investment through infrastructure projects and trade, analysts say.

China’s state-owned shipping giant Cosco, which holds a majority stake in the project, dismissed U.S. concerns and said the court ruling "in no way involves aspects of sovereignty," adding that Peruvian authorities still oversee security, environmental compliance and customs, according to The Associated Press.

Peru’s transport infrastructure regulator, Ositran, has said it plans to appeal the ruling, arguing the port should not be exempt from the same oversight applied to other major facilities.

Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told Fox News Digital that China strongly opposes what it called U.S. "false accusations and disinformation" regarding the Chancay port, citing remarks made by a Foreign Ministry spokesperson at a regular briefing on Feb. 12.

He described Chancay as a flagship China-Peru Belt and Road project and South America’s first "smart and green" port, saying the first phase is expected to cut shipping time between Peru and China to 23 days and reduce logistics costs by more than 20%, while generating about $4.5 billion annually for Peru and creating over 8,000 direct jobs. Liu said the project will strengthen Peru’s role as a regional trade gateway linking Asia and Latin America and support broader development, including environmental initiatives tied to wetlands and coastal habitats.

He added that China–Latin America partnerships are driven by shared development goals and benefit people on both sides.

Text: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings has threatened legal action against Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk after Panamanian authorities tapped the group to temporarily take over operations of two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

In a statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison warned A.P. Moller-Maersk that "any steps" the Danish group or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely "result in legal recourse." That's according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese statement.

The simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfires.

After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was "running the Panama Canal," CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port subsidiaries. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  "kowtowing" to American pressure and stalling the transaction.

Tensions intensified last month when Panama's Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a CK Hutchison subsidiary to operate the two ports was "unconstitutional." The company pushed back, saying it "strongly disagreed" with the ruling and launched arbitration proceedings against Panama.

CK Hutchison on Thursday also said it had notified Panama of the dispute under an investment protection treaty, saying it would pursue "all available recourse including additional national and international legal proceedings."

APM Terminals, the Maersk subsidiary asked to take over the ports, reportedly said it was not party to the legal dispute and had only offered to step in temporarily "to mitigate the risks that could affect essential services for regional and global trade."

Maersk shares fell over 3% in Copenhagen on Thursday.

The stakes around Panama ports have risen sharply this year. The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities.

In its strongest rebuke yet, Beijing warned on Wednesday that the Central American country "will inevitably pay a heavy price both politically and economically," unless it changes course. Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the court ruling "logically flawed" and "utterly ridiculous."

China also directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and asked shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week.

The standoff may prove more manageable for Washington than it appears, according to Reva Goujon, a director at advisory firm Rhodium Group. The U.S. retains significant leverage through its treaty with Panama, which could allow it to defend any intervention on national security grounds, she said.

But Beijing has claimed a partial victory, by derailing Washington's initial plans to acquire CK Hutchison's global port holdings outright, Goujon said.

China needs to make the U.S. "clawback in Panama as difficult as possible to avoid setting a precedent," Goujon said, noting that Chinese state-owned shipping giant Cosco's Chancay port in Peru — a key infrastructure investment by Beijing in Latin America — is also in U.S. crosshairs.

The U.S. has raised sovereignty concerns over the port of Chancay, a deep-water facility near Lima. In a post on X on Thursday, the U.S. State Department's bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Peru could be "powerless" to oversee the critical port which was "under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners."

For CK Hutchison, the lawfare will likely end in vein, analysts and law experts told CNBC.

"There's little CK Hutchison can do even with behind-the-scenes support from Beijing," Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors.

Any legal claims — including wrongful interference with property — will ultimately hinge on whether CK Hutchison's port concession is considered "live" or formally terminated, said Shahla Ali, a professor specializing in arbitration laws at the University of Hong Kong.

The duration of Maersk's control over the ports will also be scrutinized, said Ali, who views the recent legal notice as "a deterrent" to keep the door open for further negotiation.

The Panama canal — a crucial trade passage that links the Atlantic and Pacific – handles roughly 40% of all U.S. container traffic each year. CK Hutchison's subsidiary, Panama Ports Co., has operated them since 1997 and received a 25-year agreement renewal in 2021.

The canal was built in the early 20th century by the U.S. which operated it for decades before handing full control to Panama in 1999.

Analysts expected the dispute to drag on, potentially straining U.S.-China relations, already frayed by one year of tariff tensions, Beijing's tightened grip on rare earth exports, disputes over Taiwan and Washington's restrictions on tech exports.

CK Hutchison said Thursday that the continued operation of the two ports "depends solely on actions of the Panama Supreme Court and the Panamanian State," which it cannot control.

Text: Experience proved decisive as Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar shot a clutch 10.7 under pressure to overtake leader Niraj Rajput on the final shot and claim gold at the Asian Shooting Championships, setting new World and Asian records in the 50m rifle three positions event.

Aishwary’s score of 362.0 establishes the new benchmark in the revamped format, which now requires shooters to complete all three positions within a 22-minute window rather than the previous system of demarcated timings for each position.

“I have been shooting with him (Niraj) for a long time. There are a lot of competitions where we are the last two shooters. Over the years, I have learnt to shoot well in the last moments,” Aishwary said after securing the gold medal.

Asked whether he felt the pressure while chasing Niraj in the final shots, the 2025 World Championships medallist explained the mental challenge. “If you take the lead, then there is not so much pressure. Because you know that one shot won’t make a difference. But when you are behind, then there is a lot of pressure as you have to shoot well to come on the top.”

India completed a podium sweep in the final Olympic event of the championships, with Akhil Sheoran winning bronze alongside Aishwary and Niraj. The two leaders were clear from the start of the eight-shooter final. While Aishwary led after the prone section, Niraj held the advantage in the standing section before Aishwary’s dramatic overtake on the final shot.

Last year, Aishwary claimed arguably his biggest senior career medal. The 25-year-old from Bhopal won silver in the 50m rifle three positions event at the World Championships, finishing second to Olympic and World champion Liu Yukun of China. In that final, however, the situation was reversed. Aishwary was leading before the final shot, but a poor 9.8 allowed Yukun to snatch the world title.

“Yeah, I felt bad about that last shot. It was difficult to accept that I was within touching distance of becoming a World Champion. But I think losing that gold medal works as a motivation for me to go harder at this World Championships,” said Aishwary.

Despite the disappointment, the silver medal boosted his confidence significantly. “Any medal at a World Championship is good for confidence. The competition at the Worlds is quite high, as good as the Olympics. I had never medalled at Worlds before this. The medal gave me a lot of confidence and command going forward in the season,” he said.

With his current form, the 25-year-old is confident of claiming the medal that eluded him last year. “If I continue shooting like I did today, I believe that I have a good chance to secure the gold medal at the World Championships this year.”

The Asian Games and World Championships are Aishwary’s two prime targets for the 2026 season. “We don’t have the option of taking either of the tournaments lightly. Both are flagship competitions and I have my eyes set on the podium,” he said. While he will be chasing gold at the World Championships, Aishwary doesn’t have an individual medal at the Asian Games and will look to open his account at this year’s edition.

To achieve these targets, Aishwary has been focusing on fitness since the 2024 Paris Olympics. “Fitness is something I have been working on since the Paris Olympics. I have been focusing on strength and conditioning along with cardio. It has helped me and I will continue with my current fitness regime,” he said.

On Thursday, Aishwary finished third in the qualification stage with Niraj taking the top spot and Rudrankksh Patil, who was competing for ranking points, taking second. While he was brilliant in kneeling and prone with 199 points each, he slumped in standing with 190 points, usually one of his stronger areas.

However, he is not overly concerned about the low score in standing. “Yeah, standing is one of my stronger areas but I am not worried about it much. As you can see, I did well in the finals in standing. I think I didn’t get the proper rhythm during the qualification which can happen on some days.

Text: Gail Slater, head of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division resigned on Thursday after reportedly losing the support of key cabinet officials. Slater approved multiple mergers for Woke Disney while also holding up American companies taking on China’s Huawei.

As Breitbart News reported this morning, Slater resigned from her position as the head of the antitrust division with her tenure including the high profile antitrust case against Google, which failed to secure a breakup of the internet giant or any penalty beyond what most onlookers considered a slap on the wrist.

Slater originally came under fire for ignoring concerns from Trump administration intelligence officials that blocking the merger of HPE and Juniper would help empower Huawei.  As Breitbart News reported at the time, many MAGA leaders such as Charlie Kirk had the same concerns.  Slater ignored them, while greenlighting mergers from woke companies like Disney. She was also involved in the ongoing review of the widely-criticized proposed merger between Netflix and Warner Bros, although her stance on it is unclear.

But Slater had troubling items on her resume as well. Prior to becoming the DoJ’s top antitrust official, Slater was a member of the “Transatlantic High Level Working Group on Content Moderation Online” spearheaded by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at UPenn.

The working group included a string of NGOs and transnational bodies that have been dedicated to the online suppression of conservative viewpoints: the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, the German Marshall Fund (responsible for the “Hamilton 2.0” dashboard which labeled MAGA supporters Russian trolls), the Center for Democracy and Technology (relentlessly focused on shutting down Elon Musk’s X and censoring Trump supporters), and the United Nations.

In a major report, the Working Group called for “scalable solutions” to stop social media companies from “enabling the spread of disinformation, hate speech, election interference, cyber-bullying.” It praised Big Tech for “removing apps like Infowars for spreading COVID-19 disinformation” and “deleting misleading tweets from major political figures such as Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro.” The report argued this showed a “recognition by platforms of their moral/de facto responsibility as good corporate citizens for the content posted on their platforms.”

Some left-wing commentators have portrayed Slater as being beat out by corporate lobbyists. Daniel Dayen of the American Prospect posted on X that she was defeated by lobbyists who made “corrupt deals with corporate monopolists for millions of dollars.”

Luther Lowe, the head lobbyist for Y Combinator who previously served as head lobbyist for yelp and personally gave over $150,000 to  Democrats (and not a cent to Republicans) posted on X “This is not a good development for those who care about little tech.”

During the 2024 election, Y Combinator CEO Gary Tan and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman hosted a “Little Tech for Harris” fundraiser headlined by Nancy Pelosi.

Despite these portrayals as a foe of big corporations, Slater’s achievements included the approval of massive mergers for companies like Disney. She just approved the NFL-Disney Merger without even giving it a thorough “second request review.” She previously approved another Disney merger with the streaming company FUBO.

In contrast, to Slater, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has taken on Disney by investigating The View for violating equal time rules. Carr publicly noted the importance of not approving anti-competitive deals from monopolistic companies like Disney last week.

Text: Police in Germany’s Carnival hotspots say they are on high alert, but point out there are no concrete security threats to this year’s celebrations. Meanwhile, carmaker Mercedes-Benz has seen profits halve. DW has more.

This blog has now closed. Below are the latest headlines from Germany on Thursday, February 12.

Germany's luge specialists continued their domination at the Winter Olympics, claiming the team relay gold on Thursday ahead of silver medalists Austria and hosts Italy.

The luge team relay incorporates national teams of six athletes completing four runs, women's and men's singles and women's and men's doubles.

Julia Taubitz ran the women's singles, Dajana Eitberger and Magdalena Matschina ran the women's doubles, Max Langenhan ran the solo male leg, and two legends on the ice, Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt, also ran in tandem.

The win, in what will likely be Wendl and Arlt's last Olympic competition, is the duo's seventh Olympic gold since the 2014 Games in Sochi, plus one bronze for good measure, recorded in the men's doubles this year. That total is Germany's Winter Olympic record.

"Our last Olympic run was once again really great," Arlt said on ZDF television. "We are now enjoying the moment. This is the grand finale."

In five luge events, Germany has now claimed three golds, a silver and a bronze, the best overall haul of any competing nation in the discipline.

German woman Jasmin Schmidt is expecting twins — again.

The 36-year-old from Fuerth in northern Bavaria said the experience is not as extraordinary for her anymore, after giving birth to two sets of twins already. Her partner, Andreas Rittner, agreed, saying he immediately assumed it would be two babies again.

The couple's twin girls are due in early June. Twins Daniel and Emilio were born in late summer 2023, followed by twins Simone and Anastacia in late summer 2024.

Rittner said he expects even more work ahead, but also more joy. "It is definitely a really wonderful feeling," he said.

The German Society for Gynaecology and Obstetrics (DGGG) says twin pregnancies have become more common in recent years due to infertility treatments, forming 1.5% of births in 2024.

Schmidt, however, has not had any fertility treatments, making her case all the more remarkable.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has reiterated his call for a more competitive Europe, as he arrived at an informal summit of EU heads of state and government at Alden Biesen Castle in eastern Belgium.

"We want to speed up the European Union, we want to make it better, and we want to ensure that we have a competitive industry in Europe," he said ahead of the meeting.

"I expect us to take a step forward today," Merz added.

Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron arrived at the summit together, projecting an image of unity between the two traditional power centers of the EU.

"We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action," Macron said.

For a long time, European Union leaders have emphasized the urgent need to improve the functioning of the bloc's internal market to ensure the competitiveness of European businesses in the face of intense economic competition from the United States and China. The European Commission has proposed streamlining national rules to create a savings and investment union.

However, approaches in Berlin, Paris, and beyond to addressing these issues differ.

Merz has advocated for reducing the reporting burden on businesses by cutting red tape, lowering trade barriers between EU countries, and establishing more free trade agreements.

Macron, meanwhile, has called for joint debt, which Germany opposes. He is also a stern opponent of a recent free trade deal between the EU and four Latin American countries, and he pushes the idea of giving preference to European companies.

Carnival's Rose Monday Parade, scheduled for February 16, promises to be as scandalous as usual. The procession consists of 120 floats, including "persiflage floats" — satirical, mocking floats that are the centerpiece of the event.

One of them depicts Donald Trump looking into a mirror, grinning, his bare bottom exposed and covered in kiss marks — including one left by the current German chancellor.

Read more here about what we can expect to see.

The Berlin International Film Festival, or Berlinale, runs this year from February 12-22. The event is opening with an Afghan drama titled "No Good Men."

Meanwhile, stars including Pamela Anderson, Ethan Hawke and John Turturro are expected on the red carpet.

Germany's highest court has rejected a case brought by a Palestinian civilian from Gaza who was seeking to sue the German government over its weapons exports to Israel.

The complainant, who was supported by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), wanted to challenge export licences for German parts used in Israeli tanks.

He appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court after his case was rejected by lower courts in 2024 and 2025.

However, the court's judges in Karlsruhe dismissed the case, stating that "the complainant has not sufficiently substantiated that the specialised courts misjudged or arbitrarily denied a possible duty to protect him."

Although Germany is obliged to protect human rights and respect international humanitarian law, the court ruled that the state was not necessarily obliged to take specific action on behalf of individuals.

"It is fundamentally the responsibility of the state authorities themselves to decide how they fulfil their general duty of protection," the court added.

The ECCHR called the decision "a setback for civilian access to justice."

"For people whose lives are endangered by the consequences of German arms exports, access to justice remains effectively closed," said Alexander Schwarz, co-director of the NGO's International Crimes and Legal Accountability program.


German parliamentary speaker Julia Klöckner has visited the Gaza Strip, becoming the first German politician to do so since the Hamas-led attack in Israel in 2023.

The Bundestag said Klöckner spent about an hour on Thursday in a part of Gaza controlled by Israel’s military to see the situation first-hand, rejecting criticism of the visit.

Klöckner is currently on a three-day visit to Israel. The Gaza stop had not been announced in advance and has been viewed as controversial. Politico reported that the German Foreign Ministry and the German Embassy in Israel had advised against the visit.

"The ability to access different, reliable assessments of the situation is a prerequisite for responsible political judgment," Klöckner said of the trip.

She added that she welcomed Israel allowing a parliamentary observer access to Gaza for the first time, calling it an important signal given the ongoing security risks.

Former Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out any bid to become Germany's next federal president, with her office describing the notion as "absurd."



Hundreds of flights have been cancelled across Germany as pilots and flight attendants at the Lufthansa airline took strike action over pay and working conditions.

At the country's largest airport in Frankfurt, 450 of 1,117 departures were scrapped. At Munich Airport, Germany''s second largest, 275 of 920 flights were also grounded.


Mercedes-Benz has reported that its profit in 2025 has nearly halved, as difficulties in its China business and the impact of tariffs have weighed on results.

The Stuttgart-based automaker said in a statement on Thursday that net profit for the past year totaled €5.3 billion ($6.3 billion), a drop of almost 49% compared with the previous year.

Analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet had expected even weaker figures. Mercedes said "global tariffs, negative exchange rate effects and intense competition in China" had hit performance over the year.

The group also posted a 9.2% decline in revenue to €132.2 billion.

"In a dynamic market environment, our financial results were in line with our forecast," CEO Ole Källenius said, adding that the planned launch of more than 40 new models within three years would now be "accelerated further" as the company moves ahead with "a clear plan and a highly competitive product portfolio."


Police are saying the security alertness during Carnival days is still high as Fat Thursday, or "Weiberfastnacht," kicks off street celebrations in Germany’s major Carnival hubs.

The street Carnival season begins on Thursday at 11:11 a.m. with a day of celebration specially dedicated to women.

In Cologne alone, authorities expect hundreds of thousands of people to attend celebrations. To manage the crowds, the public order office is deploying up to 400 staff, along with around 2,600 security personnel from external service providers. Police are also sending up to 1,500 additional officers.

Last year, Islamists suspected of belonging to so-called Islamic State (IS) used social networks to call for attacks — including on Cologne's celebrations.

The security assessment remains one of caution. Police classify the situation as "still abstractly high." Cologne police director Martin Lotz said there were no concrete indications of planned attacks, including against large gatherings, but warned that authorities must be prepared for anything.

"It is as quiet or as unsettled as in recent years," Lotz said.

Meanwhile, Cologne Mayor Torsten Burmester has warned visitors to the city against excessive revelry and drinking.

"It's wonderful when people come to Cologne because they appreciate the vibrant nightlife here," the politician told the dpa news agency. "It's also clear that we mustn't let this degenerate..."

"There's no right to do things here that you wouldn't be allowed to do in your own hometown," he said.

Weather conditions may put a dampener on things. Germany's DWD national weather service says carnival participants should expect a rainy start, with repeated and sometimes prolonged rainfall through Friday. Forecasters also warned it could become windy, with strong to stormy gusts possible in connection with showers.

In various places, especially along the Rhine River, women storm town halls and symbolically take power.

"Weiberfastnacht" dates back to the Middle Ages, when rigid gender roles were temporarily overturned during carnival. A tradition of cutting off men's ties emerged only after 1945 and has been declining, partly because fewer people wear ties nowadays.

Guten Tag from DW’s newsroom in Bonn.

You join us as revelers in the Rhineland get ready for street Carnival season.

Festivities begin at 11:11 a.m. in cities including Cologne, Düsseldorf and Mainz with Weiberfastnacht — a celebration that marks the start of the peak phase of the Carnival season.

Police have been deploying a major security presence, with authorities expecting hundreds of thousands of costumed partygoers in the coming days.

Weiberfastnacht traditionally includes Carnival groups storming town halls, as well as numerous women's carnival events. A long-standing custom is for women to cut off men's ties to symbolize taking power.

The street Carnival season reaches its high point with the Rose Monday parades on Monday, before celebrations end on Ash Wednesday.

Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych pushed at the limits of the International Olympic Committee's rules on freedom of expression, and the global sports body pushed back. That created an emotional and historic moment of Winter Games lore.

Heraskevych insisted on wearing a helmet in competition with the images of Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed during Russia's nearly 4-year-old full-scale invasion of their country. By refusing to back down, he was disqualified from his Olympic event Thursday.

He defied a last-minute plea by IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was in tears after their early morning meeting at the sliding center in Cortina d’Ampezzo. Although disqualified from the competition, Heraskevych was not expelled from the Olympics, unlike previous athletes who staged prominent protests.

A look at the Olympic rules and previous protests:

Heraskevych had freely worn his preferred helmet on training runs, and the IOC told him he could bring it to media areas on race days.

For the actual race, however, he refused to wear an approved helmet that complied with IOC rules designed to keep the field of competition clean of political messages. Heraskevych also refused proposed IOC compromises of wearing a black armband or displaying the helmet once he was off the course.

Political neutrality is a foundational principle of the Olympic Charter, a 108-page document of 61 articles that effectively serves as the constitution of the IOC and the Olympic Games.

Rule 50 states: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”

In addition, Rule 40 states that athletes comply with “conditions of participation established by the IOC,” including where and how free expression can be displayed.

“It is not at all about the message,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a daily news conference dominated by the helmet issue. “It is simply about the sanctity of the field of play.”

Sports law expert Antoine Duval told The Associated Press it was “a huge move” for the IOC to cite Rule 40 on free expression and not the one on political propaganda.

“That is demanding that athletes are like absolute robots,” said Duval of the Asser Institute in the Netherlands, suggesting future Olympians could face scrutiny over their tattoos.

Heraskevych, 27, is at his third Winter Games and the second under the shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine, which began Feb. 24, 2022 — four days after the end of the Beijing Winter Games.

On Feb. 11 of that year, Heraskevych completed his races in China and held a small sign for the TV cameras in the blue and yellow colors of his national flag with the slogan, “No War in Ukraine.”

The IOC took no action against him, deciding this was “a general call for peace” and not an explicitly political statement.

He returned to the Olympics this year, with no end to the war in sight, and he again tried to state his views.

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

The risks of the competition being overshadowed by political statements could be even greater at the larger Summer Games like those in 2028 in Los Angeles, when the IOC wants 206 national Olympic teams, plus a refugee team, to take part.

“Think of the Middle East, think of Africa, think of South America, if everyone is allowed to express themselves in that way beyond a black armband,” Adams said “You can see where that would lead to a chaotic situation.”

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

A regular concern at Summer Games in recent years has been the issue of some athletes seeming to be pulled from competition to avoid facing an opponent from Israel.

The last major review of protest guidelines was overseen by Coventry while she was an IOC athlete representative ahead of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.

Stricter rules were in place but eased just weeks before those Games, in which women's soccer teams took a knee before the first whistle to support racial justice.

Heraskevych’s case has been compared to U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov, who made an emotional tribute in Milan this week. After his skate, he displayed a photo of himself as a child with his parents, who were killed in January 2025 when American Airlines Flight 5342 struck a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River.

Adams said Naumov's display was “a spontaneous show of emotion” after his event.

At the Paris Olympics 18 months ago, Afghan refugee Manizha Talash competed in the breaking competition wearing a cape with the slogan, “Free Afghan Women.” She was disqualified by the World DanceSport Federation.

Also in Paris, the opening ceremony saw a memorial gesture in which Algerian athletes tossed red roses from their boat into the Seine at the spot where in 1961 dozens of protesters died in a police crackdown.

Perhaps the most famous demonstration came at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City when U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood atop the medal podium after the 200 meters race. Shoeless and with their heads bowed, the two Black Americans each raised a gloved fist to protest racial injustice. They were expelled from the Games but allowed to keep their medals.

The helmet issue has put Ukraine back in the Olympic news at what could be the last games before Russia returns to the IOC fold. Russian athletes and teams have faced varying restrictions on competing — without their national identity of flag, anthem and colors — at each Olympics in the past decade because of doping scandals and the war.

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for breaking the Olympic Charter by incorporating sports councils in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed. The legal dispute is under review, and the IOC advised sports governing bodies in December to look at restoring Russian youth teams to international competitions with their full identity.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi has urged the IOC not to make concessions before the war ends.

Forests act as nurturers of biodiversity, sustain water sources, regulate microclimates, and play a critical role in carbon sequestration. In mountains, they act as natural barriers to soil erosion and landslides as their root systems bind soil. Other than their numerous ecological services, alongside cultural significance, the livelihood of millions of people is based on Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs).

In view of such ecological and socio-economic significance, forest governance plays a vital role in conserving biodiversity, sustaining livelihoods, and promoting sustainable use of forest resources. Last month, the Union Environment Ministry eased and rationalised guidelines under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 2023, allowing government and non-government entities to lease forest land for ‘forestry activity’ such as commercial plantations, restoration, etc.

Since forests are considered to be publicly owned, this marks a shift in India’s forest management efforts. For perspective, India stands at the 9th position globally in total forest area (72,739 thousand hectares) and third position in net annual forest area gain, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (GFRA) report 2025.

The GFRA report, released every five years, also revealed that about 32 per cent of the total global land area (approx. 4.14 billion hectares) is forest-covered. The first five countries contribute to more than half (54 per cent) of the global forests, i.e. the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America, and China.

Let’s understand how forests are defined in India, their types, distribution and significance.

Forest Survey of India (FSI) defines ‘Forest cover’ as all lands, more than or equal to one hectare in area, with a tree canopy of more than or equal to 10 per cent, irrespective of ownership and legal status. The FSI, which publishes the biennial India State of Forests Report (ISFR), primarily uses IRS-R2 (ResourceSat-2) LISS-III (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor-III) satellite data for mapping. The satellite has a spatial resolution of 23.5 m and cannot capture very fine details.

Thus, it also considers monocultures, plantations, orchards, bamboo, palm, etc., as forests, which may not have similar ecological value as the natural forests. However, there are frameworks that treat natural forests and plantations separately, such as:

1. Brazil’s forest-carbon accounting.

2. The European Union’s Carbon Removal Certification Framework.

3. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF).

Hence, a more nuanced definition and refined methodology can help in effective interventions to protect, restore, and conserve a ‘forest’.

India’s vegetational diversity comes from its unique geographical location, which provides varied climatic conditions. Primary factors influencing vegetation include temperature, precipitation and its seasonal distribution and elevation/altitude of the terrain.

The Tropic of Cancer divides the country into two broad climate zones: tropical climate in the south and sub-tropical climate in the north. Based on the climatic conditions and predominant vegetation type, forests in India are categorised into tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen, tropical deciduous forest, tropical thorn forest, littoral and swamp forests, and montane forests. Montane forests are located at higher altitude regions like the High Himalayan ranges and the higher hills of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Up to an elevation of 1000 metres, both tropical and subtropical regions experience similar climatic conditions: hot summers (35°C-45°C), and mild (10°C-15°C) and cool (5°C-10°C) winters, respectively. Thus, forests of these climates also exhibit more ‘resemblances’ and fewer ‘differences’.

Temperature decreases with increasing altitude, which causes a corresponding change in vegetation, from tropical to tundra type as we go upward in the high Himalayan ranges. Deciduous forests in the foothills are succeeded by wet-temperate (1000-2000 metres), cool temperate (2000-3000 metres), sub-alpine (3000-4000 metres) and alpine vegetation (4000-5000 metres).

In between, there are temperate grasslands and pastures, which have supported transhumance practice (the seasonal movement of people with their livestock between geographical or climatic regions) by tribes like Gujjars, Bakarwals, Bhotiyas, Gaddis and others.

Moreover, the south-facing slopes of the Himalayas, which induce orographic rainfall, have thicker vegetation than the drier northern slopes. Based on the canopy density, forest cover is defined as:

1. Very Dense Forest (VDF, Canopy density ≥ 70 % ).

2. Moderately Dense Forest (MDF, 40 % ≤ Canopy density < 70 %).

3. Open Forest (OF, 10 % ≤ Canopy density < 40 %).

4. Scrub (Canopy density < 10 %), and non-forest.

The huge diversity in India’s natural vegetation reflects a wide range of climatic and physiographic conditions. It spans temperate vegetation in the high-elevation areas of the Himalayas; tropical deciduous forests in northern and central India; tropical rainforests in the Western Ghats, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; mangroves in the delta regions of West Bengal and Gujarat; tropical thorn forests, grasses, and shrubs in the semi-arid regions of Rajasthan.

According to ISFR 2023, 21.76 per cent of India’s geographical area has forest cover, registering an increase of 156.41 square kilometres from the 2021 estimates. Tree cover stands at 1,12,014 sq km (3.41 per cent). This includes areas within recorded forests, such as reserved forest, protected forest, unclassed or village forests, as well as areas outside recorded forests.

Area-wise, Madhya Pradesh (77,073 sq km), Arunachal Pradesh (65,882 sq km) and Chhattisgarh (55,812 sq km) have the largest forest extent. In terms of percentage, Lakshadweep has the highest forest cover (91.33 per cent), followed by Mizoram (85.34 per cent), and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (81.62 per cent).

However, a closer reading suggests that outside recorded forests, VDF (-63.88 sq km), MDF ( -416.47 sq km), and scrub areas (-1,912.46 sq km) have decreased. Even within the recorded forests, except for an increase in VDF (+2,431.50 sq km), all other forest categories have decreased significantly. Notably, the expansion of non-forest areas both within recorded forests (+1,197.48 sq km) and outside of the recorded forest (+1,763.33 sq km) is a major cause for concern.

To sum up, a fast-growing economy like India needs to strike a balance between its developmental ambitions and its ecological health for long-term sustainable development. Forest cover and natural vegetation can help us mitigate several of our current environmental challenges, like global warming, heat waves, air and water pollution, floods, soil erosion and desertification, etc. Hence, it may be argued that there is a need for a more nuanced definition and refined methodology for more effective monitoring, protection, restoration, and conservation of forest resources.

Discuss the ecological and socio-economic significance of forests in India. How does this make effective forest monitoring and governance imperative?

Not all tree cover is forest. examine this statement in the context of India’s forest definition and assessment methods.

The recent easing of guidelines under the Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam, 2023 marks a shift in India’s forest governance. Discuss its potential implications for conservation and sustainable development.

Explain how altitude and climate influence the distribution and types of forests in India. Illustrate with suitable examples from the Himalayan and peninsular regions.

India exhibits significant diversity in natural vegetation. Discuss the geographical and climatic factors responsible for this diversity.

MILAN (AP) -- Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych pushed at the limits of the International Olympic Committee's rules on freedom of expression, and the global sports body pushed back. That created an emotional and historic moment of Winter Games lore.

Heraskevych insisted on wearing a helmet in competition with the images of Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed during Russia's nearly 4-year-old full-scale invasion of their country. By refusing to back down, he was disqualified from his Olympic event Thursday.

He defied a last-minute plea by IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was in tears after their early morning meeting at the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Although disqualified from the competition, Heraskevych was not expelled from the Olympics, unlike previous athletes who staged prominent protests.

A look at the Olympic rules and previous protests:

Heraskevych and the Olympic rules

Heraskevych had freely worn his preferred helmet on training runs, and the IOC told him he could bring it to media areas on race days.

For the actual race, however, he refused to wear an approved helmet that complied with IOC rules designed to keep the field of competition clean of political messages. Heraskevych also refused proposed IOC compromises of wearing a black armband or displaying the helmet once he was off the course.

Political neutrality is a foundational principle of the Olympic Charter, a 108-page document of 61 articles that effectively serves as the constitution of the IOC and the Olympic Games.

Rule 50 states: "No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas."

In addition, Rule 40 states that athletes comply with "conditions of participation established by the IOC," including where and how free expression can be displayed.

"It is not at all about the message," IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a daily news conference dominated by the helmet issue. "It is simply about the sanctity of the field of play."

Sports law expert Antoine Duval told The Associated Press it was "a huge move" for the IOC to cite Rule 40 on free expression and not the one on political propaganda.

"That is demanding that athletes are like absolute robots," said Duval of the Asser Institute in the Netherlands, suggesting future Olympians could face scrutiny over their tattoos.

Heraskevych's Olympic history

Heraskevych, 27, is at his third Winter Games and the second under the shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine, which began Feb. 24, 2022 -- four days after the end of the Beijing Winter Games.

On Feb. 11 of that year, Heraskevych completed his races in China and held a small sign for the TV cameras in the blue and yellow colors of his national flag with the slogan, "No War in Ukraine."

The IOC took no action against him, deciding this was "a general call for peace" and not an explicitly political statement.

He returned to the Olympics this year, with no end to the war in sight, and he again tried to state his views.

Neutral politics, protecting athletes

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

"We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition," Adams said.

The risks of the competition being overshadowed by political statements could be even greater at the larger Summer Games like those in 2028 in Los Angeles, when the IOC wants 206 national Olympic teams, plus a refugee team, to take part.

"Think of the Middle East, think of Africa, think of South America, if everyone is allowed to express themselves in that way beyond a black armband," Adams said "You can see where that would lead to a chaotic situation."

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

"We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition," Adams said.

A regular concern at Summer Games in recent years has been the issue of some athletes seeming to be pulled from competition to avoid facing an opponent from Israel.

The last major review of protest guidelines was overseen by Coventry while she was an IOC athlete representative ahead of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.

Stricter rules were in place but eased just weeks before those Games, in which women's soccer teams took a knee before the first whistle to support racial justice.

Other incidents by athletes

Heraskevych's case has been compared to U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov, who made an emotional tribute in Milan this week. After his skate, he displayed a photo of himself as a child with his parents, who were killed in January 2025 when American Airlines Flight 5342 struck a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River.

Adams said Naumov's display was "a spontaneous show of emotion" after his event.

At the Paris Olympics 18 months ago, Afghan refugee Manizha Talash competed in the breaking competition wearing a cape with the slogan, "Free Afghan Women." She was disqualified by the World DanceSport Federation.

Also in Paris, the opening ceremony saw a memorial gesture in which Algerian athletes tossed red roses from their boat into the Seine at the spot where in 1961 dozens of protesters died in a police crackdown.

Perhaps the most famous demonstration came at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City when U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood atop the medal podium after the 200 meters race. Shoeless and with their heads bowed, the two Black Americans each raised a gloved fist to protest racial injustice. They were expelled from the Games but allowed to keep their medals.

Russia's impending return

The helmet issue has put Ukraine back in the Olympic news at what could be the last games before Russia returns to the IOC fold. Russian athletes and teams have faced varying restrictions on competing -- without their national identity of flag, anthem and colors -- at each Olympics in the past decade because of doping scandals and the war.

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for breaking the Olympic Charter by incorporating sports councils in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed. The legal dispute is under review, and the IOC advised sports governing bodies in December to look at restoring Russian youth teams to international competitions with their full identity.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi has urged the IOC not to make concessions before the war ends.

Most people said joining the United States was not their goal - they want Alberta to be its own country instead.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 02:31 AM


CALGARY - Separatists in Alberta are ramping up a petition campaign aimed at triggering an independence vote in the western province that has long complained its economy is being held back by the rest of Canada.

Volunteer canvassers are hoping to collect by May 2 approximately 177,000 signatures, or 10 per cent of the province’s registered voters, the threshold required to launch a citizen-led referendum on separation from Canada.

While unlikely to result in an independent Alberta, the campaign poses a challenge to Prime Minister Mark Carney’s efforts to show a united Canadian front in the face of

US President Donald Trump’s tariffs

In the picturesque town of High River in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, a slow trickle of residents stopped by a quiet strip mall on a recent Thursday morning to sign their names to the independence petition.

While some expressed personal admiration for Mr Trump, most said joining the United States was not their goal - they want Alberta to be its own country instead.

A politically conservative province that produces most of Canada’s oil and gas, Alberta is home to long-running resentment among many that successive Liberal governments in Ottawa have hamstrung the industry’s profitability with onerous environmental regulations.

Mr Jeff Rath, the firebrand spokesman for the Alberta Prosperity Project group that supports independence, says the separatist movement is gaining pace.

He confirmed he and other activists met with US State Department officials in Washington in January to get a sense of how the US administration would respond to an independent Alberta.

Mr Rath said he floated the idea of a new oil pipeline from Alberta to the United States - which he said US officials responded to positively, noting their concerns on Ottawa’s plans to sell more energy to China.

“The only thing we’re interested in is a free and independent Alberta, not statehood,” Mr Rath said.

A White House official said US officials meet regularly with civil society groups, and no support or commitments to any group were conveyed.

A US State Department official confirmed staff-level meetings without any principals involved but said there would be no future meetings.

Asked about reports that Trump administration officials had met with Alberta separatists seeking independence, Mr Carney has said he expected the US “to respect Canadian sovereignty.”

Canada is the world’s fourth largest oil producer, and oil and gas is the country’s most valuable export product.

The vast majority of Canadian oil and gas is produced in Alberta, where the energy sector is a significant employer and oil and gas tax revenues contribute substantially to provincial government coffers.

High River resident Darell Seib said he believes Alberta – which is politically conservative and celebrates its ranching, rodeos and maverick cowboy culture – is distinct from the rest of Canada.

“People are independent, people are entrepreneurial, we work hard,” he said. “We’re different. We need to have more of our governance closer to home.”

Other separatists expressed resentment that the rest of the country doesn’t appreciate Alberta’s contribution to Canada’s economy.

Data shows the province contributed almost as much to Canada’s economic growth in 2024 as the country’s most populous province Ontario, even though Alberta’s population is three times smaller.

Several separatists Reuters spoke to declined to be named out of fear of facing criticism from neighbours.

Recent polling shows separatist sentiment is not backed by the majority in Alberta, with 71 per cent of residents polled wanting to remain in Canada.

But nearly one in five people support the idea of Alberta becoming an independent country, according to polling in February by Mr Leger.

Mr Rath would not say how many signatures separatists have.

But a referendum could be held as early as October if the petition is successful.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith’s government made several legislative changes in 2025 making it easier for separatists to trigger a referendum, including cutting the number of required signatures in half.

Mr Smith said in a statement to Reuters that her government supports a strong and sovereign Alberta within a united Canada, “but citizen-initiated referenda allow for people to express views that might be different than that.”

She said she has been working with Mr Carney to address frictions between Alberta and the federal government.

Since electoral officials in Alberta also certified a separate petition put forward by an ex-deputy premier declaring that Alberta should remain a province of Canada, a referendum on that could also be held this fall.

“It’s absolutely bonkers,” said Professor Duane Bratt, a political science expert at Mount Royal University in Calgary.

“Smith may say that she’s not a separatist, but she has gone out of her way many times to make it easier for a separatist referendum to be held.”

Still, Assistant Professor Adrienne Davidson from McMaster University said there are multiple obstacles before Alberta could become an independent country, including the lack of a clear threshold of voters needed for the federal government to begin secession talks.

A decades-long separatist movement in the French-speaking province of Quebec could also produce a mandate for a third independence referendum there after a provincial election this October, further complicating the picture for Mr Carney and possibly accelerating sovereignty calls in Alberta, academics said.

The separatist Parti Quebecois has been leading in polls and has promised to hold a referendum by 2030 if it wins the October election.

Mr Carney has sought to fend off the Alberta separatist movement by offering concessions, including signing an agreement with Ms Smith in November to roll back certain climate rules and encourage construction of a new oil pipeline to the West Coast.

Mr Gabriel Brunet, a spokesman for Mr Dominic LeBlanc, Canada’s minister for intergovernmental affairs, said Alberta was “an essential partner” for Ottawa.

“Canada’s new government is engaged in renewing the Canada-Alberta relationship based on common objectives and respect,” Mr Brunet said in a statement. REUTERS

FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson has called on Tim Cook to review possible political bias in Apple News' practices after allegations that the platform is censoring conservative news outlets.

"Recently, there have been reports that Apple News has systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed news articles from more conservative publications," Ferguson wrote in a letter posted to X on Wednesday.

Apple declined to comment on the letter.

The focus on perceived conservative censorship has been a regular theme of the Trump administration, with the White House launching a media bias section of its website in December.

The webpage includes an 'offender hall of shame' that names a story weekly that the administration finds misleading.

A portal was announced the same week, "calling on everyday Americans to support the truth and hold the Fake News accountable" by submitting biased articles.

Apple can legally promote any content it wants to on its news platform, which Ferguson acknowledged.

"We do not have the authority to require Apple or any other firm to take affirmative positions on any political issue, nor to curate news offerings consistent with one ideology or another," he wrote.

Ferguson's letter cited a study from the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group, that looked at featured stories on Apple News during morning time slots in January.

According to the study, outlets considered right-leaning by AllSides media bias ratings were not featured in a 620-story sample.

President Donald Trump shared a New York Post write-up of the study on his Truth Social account early Wednesday.

Apple has so far navigated Trump's second term fairly well, weathering the early tariff blitz and crackdown on China manufacturing, which included the president's desire to have iPhones made in the U.S.

Cook hand-delivered a gold-and-glass trophy to Trump in the Oval Office in August as the company pledged another $100 billion to bolster U.S. manufacturing.

According to Section 5 of the FTC Act, the news aggregator could be violating terms if its suppression or promotion "is contrary to consumers' reasonable expectations such that failure to disclose the ideological favoritism is a material omission."

Ferguson told Cook to undergo a "comprehensive review" and take corrective action if the Apple News curation is not consistent with the company's terms of service.

Russia announced Thursday it had blocked WhatsApp over its alleged failure to comply with Russian legislation, days after restricting access to rival messaging service Telegram for similar reasons.

Moscow has for months been trying to shift users onto Max, a domestic messaging service that lacks end-to-end encryption and which activists have called a potential surveillance tool.

Critics say the restrictions are part of a broader campaign by Russian authorities to tighten control over internet use and more easily monitor Russian citizens online.

Here's what we know about both apps and Russia's attempts to push users onto Max.

WhatsApp

WhatsApp, which has over 100 million users in Russia, is owned by US tech giant Meta.

The app was the most popular messaging service among Russians aged 25 and over in 2023, while Telegram was more popular among younger users, according to a report by Russian news outlet RBK.

Russia announced it was blocking calls on both applications last August, accusing them of facilitating crime.

It has since progressively slowed down WhatsApp and in November announced it would ban the platform outright unless it complied with Russian legislation.

Russia has asked for both messengers to provide access to data when requested by law enforcement for fraud probes and for investigating activities Russia describes as "terrorist".

Rights advocates fear that would extend Russia's surveillance state and could be used to target critics of the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin or the war in Ukraine.

WhatsApp said Wednesday that Russia had finally "attempted to fully block" the service, which the Kremlin confirmed on Thursday.

It was unclear how widespread or effective Russia's attempts were.

VPN users in Russia still seem able to circumvent the ban.

Telegram

Telegram, founded by Russian-born entrepreneur Pavel Durov, is the most popular messaging service in Russia, boasting more than one billion monthly active users worldwide.

Russia's internet watchdog announced it was throttling access to the app on Tuesday, accusing it of failing to follow legislation.

It was not immediately clear if Russia planned to ban the application outright.

Russian officials -- including the Kremlin -- still use it to issue statements and it is the most popular outlet for pro-government military bloggers commenting on the Ukraine war.

Some have warned that blocking the app would hobble communications around the front line and in Russian-occupied territory.

Durov, who now lives outside Russia, has called the Kremlin's restrictions "an attempt to force its citizens to switch to a state-controlled app built for surveillance and political censorship".

He has clashed with the Russian authorities before.

He was forced out of the VK social media site he founded -- a Russian equivalent of Facebook -- under pressure from the authorities.

Russia spent two years trying to block Telegram, but having failed either to restrict access or to stop the growth of the service, it lifted the ban in 2020.

Max

Max, released by Russian social media giant VK last year, has been touted as a "super app" -- capable of doing everything from accessing government services to ordering a pizza, similar to China's WeChat or Alipay.

The government directed manufacturers to include it on all new phones and tablets starting last September, and it claimed 75 million users by December.

But it has been met with skepticism from some Russians, some of whom have told AFP they were forced to download it by their employers.

Unlike WhatsApp, Max appears to lack end-to-end encryption, meaning messages are not scrambled while traveling between the reader and sender and could possibly be retained by the state.

Sarkis Darbinyan, co-founder of digital rights NGO Roskomsvoboda, told AFP last year that shifting users onto Max could also allow authorities to limit information it does not want users to see.

Russia is moving people to a "kind of vacuum, where they do not have that undesirable information", he said.

Text: Back in 2016, German trust in the United States was at all-time high. Today the situation could not be more different. This is mostly due to US President Donald Trump and his unpredictable policies.

When Barack Obama moved into the White House in 2009, he sparked a wave of enthusiasm in Germany that, looking back now, seems almost surreal. After the tensions of the George W. Bush era, the new US president's approval ratings among Germans skyrocketed.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 93% of Germans believed Obama would "do the right thing regarding world affairs." That remains a record to this day. Even in 2016, at the end of his second term, an extraordinary 86% of Germans still trusted Obama. Under his leadership, the United States was considered a reliable partner and role model. This was despite the fallout following damaging leaks revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden .

But this all changed when Donald Trump won his first presidential election in 2016. German trust in the US president plummeted to a fraction of what it had been. A poll conducted towards the end of his first term found that only about 10% of respondents still trusted him.

And that has not changed significantly during his second term. While the majority of Germans viewed relations with the US positively when Obama and his successor Joe Biden were in power, by the middle of last year 73% said in the Politbarometer, a poll conducted by German broadcaster ZDF, that relations with the US under Trump were "bad."

According to a new poll by the Allensbach Institute, a German market research institute, two-thirds of Germans currently see the US as "one of the greatest threats to world peace" alongside Russia and China.

The drop in approval has a lot to do with Donald Trump as an individual and the radical change of course the US has taken under his leadership. While almost all his predecessors considered NATO and the European Union important allies and emphasized common ground, the US under Trump has been different.

The Trump administration has insisted that EU member states should bear more responsibility for their own security and increase their military spending accordingly. Trump has repeatedly snubbed the US' European allies, whether with regard to the Russia-Ukraine war or over his plans to take over Greenland. In Germany, the US is increasingly regarded as an unreliable partner.

While campaigning for president in February 2024, Trump said at an event that if he were re-elected he would not protect NATO partners in the event of an attack by Russia if they had not invested what he thought was enough in their own defense. He even said that he was prepared to "encourage" the Russian authorities "to do whatever the hell they want" to any NATO country.

Such statements have made a strong impression in Germany, where only just under a third of people think the US would provide military assistance if a European NATO member state were attacked.

The US president's aggressive tariff and economic policies have also left scars. Most goods imported from the EU are now subject to a 15% tariff, while for steel and aluminum, the tariff is as high as 50%. German companies have been hit hard and their exports to the US fell by more than 9% in 2025 compared to the previous year.

According to a study by the German Economic Institute in Cologne, German companies reduced their direct investments in the US by around 45% between February and November 2025 compared to the same period the previous year. There is continued uncertainty because of the threat of more tariffs, for example with regard to the Greenland controversy.

"Business conditions have declined considerably," said Roland Rohde, an expert on the US at Germany Trade and Invest, a foreign trade investment agency owned by the German government. "The mood among German companies has deteriorated significantly over the year as a whole," he told DW. Although German companies have not turned away from the US as a sales market, they are currently avoiding major investments because of the government's unpredictable trade policies.


The US remains the most popular destination for German travelers outside of Europe but currently many Germans are reluctant to go to there on vacation because of the country's tough immigration policies and stricter entry requirements. Between January and July 2025, just under 780,000 German tourists flew to the US, around 12% fewer than the same period in the previous year.

"The US has an image that stands for freedom and individuality," aviation expert Heinrich Grossbongardt told German business weekly Wirtschaftswoche. "But vacationers don't want to see the National Guard patrolling in Los Angeles and raids against immigrants."

People are also deterred by plans to require foreign tourists entering the US to share five years of their social media history, as well as reports of Germans suddenly finding themselves in detention or being deported. The number of applications for student exchanges in the US fell significantly last year with some media reports speaking of a 50% decline.

It is clear there is an immense loss of trust in the US but as a look at the past 20 years shows, this need not be permanent. While there were very low approval ratings for George W. Bush and Trump, they shot up again for Obama and Biden. A change in the Oval Office, or at least a more friendly attitude towards Europe in Washington, could possibly restore trust.

Text: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has selected his daughter as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday.

Kim Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - has in recent months been pictured beside her father in high-profile events like a visit to Beijing in September, her first known trip abroad.

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a "range of circumstances" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events" in making this assessment.

The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.

The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.

On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being "trained" to be a successor, was now at the stage of "successor designation".

"As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor," Lee said.

Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.

News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he "held baby Ju Ae" during a trip to the secretive state.

Ju Ae made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand.

She has since made frequent appearances on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator.  She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.

She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.

Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader.

The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.

In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him.

In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.

Although the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.

It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society.

Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.

Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.

However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.

It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea.

Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father.

Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.

Deepak Kumar's confronting of Hindu vigilantes is being hailed as a rare act of heroism. It's also got him death threats.

The fishing boat tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection inside Japan's territorial waters, authorities say.

Voters are hoping for a return to democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Sheikh Hasina.

Zhang Youxia, widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was in January removed from his post.

A gunman who laid siege to the school shot the principal and another female student who is out of danger.

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran Thursday with "very traumatic" consequences if it fails to make a nuclear deal -- but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was skeptical about the quality of any such agreement.

Speaking a day after he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said he hoped for a result "over the next month" from Washington's negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.

"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters. "This will be very traumatic for Iran if they don't make a deal."

Trump -- who is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to pressure Iran -- recalled the U.S. military strikes he ordered on Tehran's nuclear facilities during Israel's 12-day war with Iran in July last year.

"We'll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can't, we'll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them," Trump said.

Netanyahu had traveled to Washington to push Trump to take a harder line in the Iran nuclear talks, particularly on including the Islamic Republic's arsenal of ballistic missiles.

But the Israeli and U.S. leaders apparently remained at odds, with Trump saying after their meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he had insisted the negotiations should continue.

Netanyahu said in Washington on Thursday before departing for Israel that Trump believed he was laying the ground for a deal.

"He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn't reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal," Netanyahu said, according to a video statement from his office.

But the Israeli premier added: "I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran."

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

"It's not just the nuclear issue," he said.

Despite their differences on Iran, Trump signaled his strong personal support for Netanyahu as he criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog for rejecting his request to pardon the prime minister on corruption charges.

"You have a president that refuses to give him a pardon. I think that man should be ashamed of himself," Trump said on Thursday.

Trump has repeatedly hinted at potential U.S. military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests last month, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman.

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel's war with Iran and the U.S. strikes.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear program. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to "excessive demands" on the subject.


Apply Now



Cry wolf all you like Trump.....you got military advice last round of threats NOT to go ahead and stage a full scale attack

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Exactly.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu. Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu.

Oh, I disagree

Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Yeah, sure. lol

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

So Trump is sending the fleet to bomb Iran....after saying this during his campaign...

"During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump’s comments on Middle East conflicts focused on ending wars and emphasizing his "America First" non-interventionist stance.

Ending "Endless Wars": Trump campaigned on the promise to "turn the page forever on those foolish, stupid days of never-ending wars," often contrasting himself with "warmongers" like Nikki Haley.

Peace Through Strength: He maintained that his legacy would be that of a "peacemaker," claiming he was the only president in generations who did not start a new war.

And one more campaign promise betrayed...

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

I think the guy is a genius, no capitulation, no apologies and keeping Iran on their toes and on high notice.

The convicted felon and Intimidator-in-Chief has spoken.

War mongering and peace making are quite the contrary.

When Biden did this he was a ‘fake tough guy war monger’.

What changed?

Bass....well Trump is a genius in not paying taxes.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if he can't bury the Epstein files.

FIFY


A reminder that Iran signed a nuclear agreement in 2015 with six countries, including the United States, Russia and China. The purpose of the agreement was to ease economic sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear development program. However, in 2018, during his first term in office, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement.

Iran insists that its nuclear development program is designed for peaceful purposes — securing nuclear fuel for nuclear power generation — and that it will continue uranium enrichment.

To put into contest the hypocrisy of the US administration, let’s not forget that Mossadegh, Iran's prime minister, was overthrown in a 1953 CIA-backed coup known as Operation Ajax. His government had nationalized Iran's oil industry, angering both the British and the U.S. After his removal, the Shah was restored to power, marking the beginning of an authoritarian regime until the 1979 Revolution.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

What does it have to do with anything, you always go on some weird  tangent, it has nothing to do with Biden capitulating to Iran and Trump doing what he said he is going to do, liberals can talk about convicted felon all this other nonsense, but what is clear and what only matters is that he's putting these mullets unnoticed and that is a good thing for the United States and for the world, especially the region

Still the typical so-called tough guy, but no one is scared except his supporters.

But but billionaire Trump didn’t pay taxes?

umm…what? Iran? Huh?

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

at least he’s back to billionaire again in the new narratives.

Handing over the own Afhanistan trauma to Iran or suffer another own Big Armada trauma, that is a fifty-fifty outcome. Better toss a coin, that's less bloody.

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

Not since he started moonlighting selling crypto instead of working for his actual bosses.

Try telling your boss you can “walk and chew gum” when he finds you’re not doing your job, see how that goes.

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

BlacklabelToday  12:43 pm JST

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

oh did one of his sons sell finger paintings for millions of dollars (that are now somehow totally worthless) or something?

instead of working for his actual bosses.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if there is no nuclear deal

Has he got some trash racist memes ready to go on Truth Social?

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

Don't need to have troops on the ground to help destabilize the nation.

Yep he does. But really just satire. A funny joke or two.

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

Not so different from your favorite previous WH occupants then.

As much hate as your team has thrown at Biden, that's some admission - "he's the same as Joe"...and thanks for admitting he's a corrupt grifter...

Remember when Trump and MAGA-world condemned its fellow Repub NEOCONs as "warmongers who start endless conflicts in the Middle East"....and that he was going to "end all wars"?

Yea, that was THEN....now it's "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran"...."Send in the Marines"...."Get tough"....

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES....

Surprised?  Shouldn't be...

"I'll protect the unborn"....flat out lie....he's OK with 15 week abortions...

"I'll defend the 2nd Amendment"....clear lie - he's now for gun control....

"I'll release the Epstein file"...we know what a "huuuge" lie that turned out be....

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...and a lot of them are outraged...at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES

oh are we at war with anyone right now?

if so, who and where?

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...

No, he really didn't not to the point where its enraging anyone

and a lot of them are outraged...

Some, but that just goes with the territory

at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

All politicians lie, but most of policy executions done extraordinarily well.

Text: Mia Brookes is a strong contender for a medal in the snowboard slopestyle

For some years, it has been said, Great Britain has been punching above its weight in winter sports.

No ice track, few snowy mountains, and yet world champions, X Games medallists and World Cup podium finishes aplenty.

But right now, those punches are coming in the opposite direction - and they feel heavy.

Many expected Team GB to be on the medal table by now, with at least three, perhaps four medals on the board. Instead, the total remains at zero.

There have been three agonising fourth-place finishes for freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, snowboarder Mia Brookes, and curlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, while a solitary error cost figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson dearly when they had been battling for a bronze in the ice dance.

But it has demonstrated just how tight the margins are.

Take Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.

Had she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.

Brookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.

She landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.

Had she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.

Sometimes, those fine margins work in Great Britain's favour. Twelve years ago at the Sochi Games, snowboarder Jenny Jones won bronze - Team GB's first Olympic medal on snow - in the slopestyle by just 0.25 of a point.

"I could have very much been in fourth," Jones told BBC Sport.

"The girl who came fourth, she did a bigger trick than me, but she dragged her hand. On the day, I had done it cleaner. On any other day, she might have beaten me.

"There's lots more going on with the Olympics, mentally. It is that psychological element, it's a mindset.

"They are all so capable, and they can do these things, but it is about who has got that mental advantage on the day.

"We should not be disappointed at all in our athletes, we should be celebrating how well they are doing on a world stage. We have so much more to look forward to."

'Several versions of success' - but women's curlers dream of medal


Britain's best medal haul from a Winter Games is five - at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 - but before the Games, UK Sport said up to eight medals could be won.

While eight now looks like it could be a stretch, a record-breaking Games is still on the cards.

Dame Katherine Grainger, chair of the British Olympic Association, says "questions will be asked" if that is not achieved - particularly given the £25.5m UK Sport has ploughed into Olympic winter sports over the last four years.

"Because it's public money, there's a responsibility for all of us to make sure the money that goes in is paid back," she told BBC Sport.

"We want to see great performances, inspirational performances, and that there's good value for money. I think the results will be brilliant and it will justify the investment."

Dame Katherine, who won multiple Olympic medals during a stellar rowing career, admits the talent within Team GB rightly increases scrutiny.

"We know the potential is to attain a record number of medals, and if that potential is not achieved then we have a responsibility across all of us to understand where that went wrong," she added.

"That potential is very real. There rightly will be questions if we do not achieve that."

It is too early to have those conversations, because all is not lost.

Team GB has plenty of medal chances still to come - and this is where we might see them.

Sport: Skeleton

Competition dates: 12 February (men's heats one and two), 13 February (men's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).

Matt Weston is in sublime form and leads the men's skeleton after two of four races.

He's a two-time world champion and won three successive overall World Cup titles between 2023 and 2026.

He won five of seven World Cup golds this season, picking up silver behind team-mate Marcus Wyatt in the other two.

GB's Weston in prime position to win skeleton gold

Sport: Skeleton

Competition dates: 13 February (women's heats one and two), 14 February (women's heats three and four), 15 February (mixed team).

Tabby Stoecker finished in a top-three position in all six official women's training runs, including twice in top spot.

She has one World Cup victory to her name and, with Weston, has two World Championship silver medals to her name in the mixed team event.

Stoecker and Weston will likely team up again when the event makes its Olympic debut on Sunday.

Sport: Snowboard cross

Competition dates: 13 February (women's), 15 February (mixed team).

Charlotte Bankes was crowned world champion in 2021 and won the mixed team title two years later with British team-mate Huw Nightingale.

She has twice won the Crystal Globe - the overall World Cup title - and finished second in the standings in 2024 and 2025, the latter season curtailed by a broken collarbone.

She won her first race since returning from injury in January.

Sport: Freestyle skiing (halfpipe)

Competition dates: 19 February (qualifying), 21 February (finals).

Zoe Atkin is the reigning halfpipe world champion.

She has achieved three podium finishes from three starts on the World Cup circuit this season, including a gold.

She also won gold at the recent X Games.

Sport: Snowboarding (slopestyle)

Competition dates: 16 February (qualifying), 17 February (finals)

Mia Brookes came so close to a medal in the big air but has an arguably better chance in her preferred slopestyle.

In 2023, she became the youngest world champion in snowboarding history at the age of 16 with slopestyle gold.

She has won back-to-back big air Crystal Globes and won World Cup gold in December, as well as slopestyle gold and big air bronze at the recent X Games.

Sport: Freestyle skiing (big air)

Competition dates: 14 February (qualifying), 16 February (finals)

Kirsty Muir was devastated after missing out on a slopestyle medal but another shot is coming her way in the big air.

She is a two-time World Cup gold medallist, her second coming in the big air in Secret Garden, China, in November.

At the recent X Games in Aspen she won slopestyle gold and big air silver.

Sport: Curling

Competition dates: 11-22 February

Bruce Mouat's men's rink are the curling world champions, having also won the title in 2023.

They won three successive European crowns between 2021 and 2023, and silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics.

On Wednesday, they beat China 9-4 in their opening match against China.

Keep an eye out for Brad Hall's two-man and four-man sleds in the men's bobsleigh.

They have been no stranger to World Cup podiums in recent years and get their campaigns under way on 16 February (two-man) and 21 February (four-man).

At the curling, Jen Dodds will hope to brush off the disappointment of the mixed doubles with Team Morrison in the women's event, as they look to defend the gold medal won by Eve Muirhead's women's team in Beijing.

Updated  - February 13, 2026 10:59 am IST


Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally acknowledged the new world order. The hard part is to formulate a new national identity and approach to international relations.

India’s leadership of the Global South at the United Nations General Assembly was the foundation of its long-standing foreign policy of ‘strategic autonomy’. The global rules agreed in the UN established by former colonial powers led by the U.S. served their interests in the post-colonial world. India’s Oxbridge-educated diplomats had unquestioned leadership in the UN negotiating text on principles and rules, successfully diverting pressure on poor countries. Climate negotiations ending in 1992 were left entirely to India by the Global South.

However, China’s rise around 2010, through the creation of alternative funding, economic and security institutions, impacted the intellectual leadership position of India and also changed the UN irreversibly. China heads four principal UN agencies, and its aid volumes exceed those of the West. The U.S., now unable to manage the UN process, has withdrawn from 31 UN institutions.

In 1986, the U.S. launched the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, leading to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, where developing countries’ interests became more differentiated, and India struggled to secure its interests. In a more equal world, since 2019, the U.S. has rejected the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO, making it dysfunctional and reverting to unilateral tariffs. China, in contrast, has diversified its exports away from the U.S. and is now the largest trading partner of 120 countries.

The problem India faces is not from the rise of China. While the EU and Canada acknowledge the collapse of the multilateral structures, developing countries are wondering how to revive them. With the potential to become the world’s third-largest economy, India is particularly impacted in the U.S.-dominated world of transactional relationships, even willing to discard NATO.

First, leadership of the Global South gave India outsized influence and now where do you speak for developing countries when international institutions and law have withered away? The U.S. and China are competing for technological dominance, not votes in the UN.

Second, ‘strategic autonomy’ applied to the Cold War when India led the Non-Aligned Movement. It lost relevance after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and gradually became a self-declared identity used to rationalise foreign policy choices. India joined the U.S.-led rejuvenated Quad in 2017 and then chose the Russian S-400 missile system over the U.S. Patriot system in 2018.

The reality is that India gravitated towards the Soviet Union after its 1951 veto prevented discussion of Kashmir in the UN Security Council. Russia remains India’s only long-trusted partner giving cutting-edge military technology, which the U.S. is chipping away at testing India’s resolve to remain a third pole in a multipolar world.

Third, with China’s rise, U.S. analysts began describing India not as strategically autonomous but as a “swing state.” The current U.S. military strategy rejects containment of China.

The major scope of international relations, outside of alliances, was within multilateral institutions which has now returned to asymmetric relations. Reciprocity in tariffs is redefined as “America first”, implying others are in a subordinate relationship. Under the India-U.S. Framework Agreement, India has agreed to double imports, largely industrial products, while the U.S. continues an 18% tariff, unilaterally deciding reductions clearly after further concessions. The EU trade agreement eliminated 70% tariff lines with phased reciprocal reductions.

The real question for India is why it was targeted by the U.S. tariffs and how to grow in a world marked by flux.

The U.S. is determined to prevent the rise of another China and India alone has the potential to overtake the U.S. China exploited multilateral rules to become a fiercely independent global manufacturing power and that opportunity no longer exists. The long-term U.S. policy of keeping India apart from Russia and China has now gained greater force and blunting it will test Indian diplomacy.

India’s comparative advantage lies in its young population; nearly half of Silicon Valley’s workforce traces its roots to India. Building and attracting that talent can develop the capability to become a ‘cyber superpower’, spreading AI across security, manufacturing and services to secure development space.

To achieve this, India needs good economic and technological relations with the U.S., Russia, and China, Free Trade Agreements (FTA), and, importantly foreign policy replacing ‘strategic autonomy’ with ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’.

First, taking a leaf from China and the U.S. in the early 1900s, India should bide its time, maintain a low international profile and develop endogenous capabilities, requiring a diplomatic posture to accelerate the Asian Century and a passive role in all other regions.

Second, India must prioritise trade diplomacy by diversifying exports away from the U.S., even as vulnerabilities remain in bilateral relationships. Now that India is open to industrial imports, the push for FTAs must continue with Asia, soon to have two-thirds of global wealth, and Africa, the fastest-growing continent.

Third, India should create new technological, cyber and space relations with Russia, its steadfast and tested partner, now more an Asian than European power. It should also enable China to invest in infrastructure and partner manufacturing, with safeguards, to take advantage of trade opportunities and accelerate growth.

Fourth, India should treat relations with Pakistan as a foreign policy issue rather than a security challenge. A new water-sharing arrangement incorporating the needs of the Kashmir Valley, revival of the Iran-Pakistan-India Peace Pipeline with Pakistan benefiting from transit fees, and even a trade agreement could create economic incentives.

Lastly, as chair of BRICS, India has an opportunity to articulate its new foreign policy by building consensus on repositioning BRICS as an economic cooperation community, not a political multilateral body. Linking official digital currencies to make cross-border trade, repatriation and tourism payments smoother will be a good first step.

Text: Africa's heads of state are gathering in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for their annual meeting this weekend at a time when the continent's place in the world appears to be in flux.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking in Davos last month, described an arresting image of the future of international relations: either countries were at the table or they were on the menu.

For Africa's leaders, who for years have been arguing that they should be dining at the top table, it was not an unfamiliar analogy.

But in his second term, US President Donald Trump has accelerated the trend towards great-power domination of world affairs and the ditching of multilateralism.

As the White House's updated security strategy says, not every region in the world can get equal attention. Trump's pivot towards the Western hemisphere, as well as time spent on the Middle East, has implied less focus on Africa.

The less powerful nations, who may have once relied on the norms, as well as the finance, of global bodies such as the UN, World Bank or World Trade Organization, are now having to re-evaluate relationships.

These moves have given fresh urgency to the question of how the continent should deal with the rest of the world.

For Tighisti Amare, director of the Africa programme at the UK-based Chatham House think-tank, there is a danger that African countries will be "left behind" if they fail to develop an effective common strategy.

But already, for the US, there is a menu full of tempting bilateral deals involving minerals and natural resources, which bypass any opportunity for collective bargaining on the part of the continent.

When it comes to Africa, the policy shift reflected in pronouncements from Washington is dizzying.

A little over three years ago, then-President Joe Biden told the continent's leaders at a summit in the US capital, that "the United States is all-in on Africa's future".

This followed a White House strategy document on sub-Saharan Africa which described the region as "critical to advancing our global priorities".

Critics, however, have questioned whether this really did penetrate the Oval Office, with Biden's only visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president - to Cape Verde, briefly, and Angola - coming in the last full month of his term.

In contrast to the official statements from his predecessor, Trump's America First approach has a much narrower idea of US interests.

"We cannot afford to be equally attentive to every region and every problem in the world," the White House's National Security Strategy stated last November.

The three paragraphs on Africa at the end spoke about partnering with "select countries to ameliorate conflict, foster mutually beneficial trade relationships" and move from supplying aid to encouraging investment and economic growth.

For Peter Pham, who was a special envoy to Africa during Trump's first administration, this is a more honest approach.

"I was trained in the realist school of international relations," he told the BBC, "and I'm not delusional enough to think that Africa is front and centre of US interests as much as it's maybe front and centre of my life.

"There's no way any country, even a superpower, can be all things to everyone. The reality is we don't have the bandwidth nor the resources, as generous as the American people have been, to do everything for everyone.

"So we have to husband those resources and steward them as best we can to achieve the optimal outcome for obviously our own citizens, but also our partners writ large."

One of the clearest expressions of this was the minerals deal that the US struck with the Democratic Republic of Congo in December, which happened in tandem with the signing of a peace deal with Rwanda.

It was aimed at "building secure, reliable and durable supply chains for critical minerals" for the US, according to the text, as well as encouraging investment in DR Congo, which has huge reserves of minerals essential for the manufacture of electronic goods.

Pham himself is part of another deal as he is chairman of Ivanhoe Atlantic a company involved in the development of the "Liberty Corridor", a project building new infrastructure linking Guinea's vast iron ore mines to a Liberian port to boost exports of the raw material.

Ken Opalo, an Africa specialist at Georgetown University's school of foreign service in Washington, is worried that the US's transactional, bilateral approach "means that the bargaining position for African countries will be terribly weak and therefore they may not get the best deals possible".

He told the BBC that if "the DR Congo example is anything to go by, the US focus on minerals is about merely securing mining rights for American companies and little else in terms of the broader economic co-operation, which is not what the region needs.

"The region needs deeper market access, investment treaties and the ability to attract US capital for all sectors not just mining."

DR Congo's Mines Minister Louis Watum Kabamba dismissed these concerns. Speaking at a mining summit in Cape Town this week, he said his country was not going to "sell everything for nothing to America".

Of course, the US is not the only big power involved. China, for more than a decade, outspent the US in terms of foreign direct investment in Africa, though this position was reversed last year.

Other countries, such as Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are also striking their own investment and security deals.

The transactional approach is not necessarily bad, Opalo said, but he argued that there is not the strategic depth of thinking going on, or diplomatic expertise, in African governments "to play this game well". This means leaders may go for easy wins without considering the long-term implications, he feared.

On the security front, Africa's failure to resolve the civil war in Sudan, triggering what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis, could be seen as an example of this, Opalo added.

Despite its officially neutral stance, Turkey has been accused of supplying the Sudanese army with weapons. Iran and Russia also face the same accusation. All have been met with denials, but last February Russia signed a deal with Sudan's military government to set up a naval base in the country.

On the other side, the UAE has been accused of backing the Rapid Support Forces, which it also denies.

"The failure to sort Sudan out is symptomatic of the lack of agency that the continent has," Opalo said.

Ghana's President John Mahama, for one, is trying to shift this assessment.

Mahama, like Carney, also spoke at the Swiss ski resort Davos.

He said that with "an unpredictable ally across the Atlantic" and shrinking development assistance, the world was at an "inflexion point".

"Africa must pull itself up by its own bootstraps," he argued.

In a passionate address he declared that the continent had lost its sovereignty and was caught in a dependency trap. This was true both in areas of aid spending - such as health and education - as well as security matters, he said, adding that when it comes to natural resources, "we supply the world's critical minerals but capture almost none of the value".

The president's prescription, through his Accra Reset project, is more investment in relevant skills, co-ordinated industrialisation across Africa's regions and joined-up continental negotiation with outside partners.

But these are calls that have been heard before and the question is whether there is a greater chance now that something will change.

For analyst Tighisti the "key challenge is that to create a united front, leaders should be more focused on regional interests. Sometimes this means that national interests have to be put aside if they really want agency in international negotiations."

In his Davos speech, the Canadian prime minister called for the world's "middle powers" to act together. In Africa these could include Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa.

But Tighisti said that while "these are the countries that everyone is looking up to, there is a lack of continental leadership to really push the integration agenda".

One key problem is that many leaders are very inward-facing, as "they themselves have huge domestic challenges that they need to address at the same time".

She added that there was already the framework for countries to work more closely through things such as the continent's free trade area - a project aimed at boosting commerce between African countries  - and the African Union's Agenda 2063, described as a master plan for transforming the continent, but progress on these has been slow.

Laying out his pitch in Switzerland, Mahama said that "Africa intends to be at the table in determining what that new global order will look like".

But there is still a lot of work to do to get the most out of the shift in US foreign policy as well as the continent's other partners – the dinner invitations are not yet being sent out.

Text: Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference this week

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation this week to the Munich Security Conference where increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump’s often inconsistent policies and threats that have roiled transatlantic relations and the post-World War II international order.

A year after Vice President JD Vance stunned assembled dignitaries at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America’s closest allies in Europe, accusing them of imperiling Western civilization with left-leaning domestic programs and not taking responsibility for their own defense, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering of world leaders and national security officials Saturday, U.S. officials say.

The State Department’s formal announcement of Rubio’s trip offered no details about his two-day stop in Munich, after which he will visit Slovakia and Hungary. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the trip, said America's top diplomat intends to focus on areas of cooperation on shared global and regional concerns, including in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as China, an economic powerhouse seeking to take advantage of the uncertainty in U.S.-European ties.

Should that be the case, many in the audience may be relieved after being buffeted first by Vance’s blunt rebukes last year and then a series of Trump statements and moves in the months since that have targeted virtually every country in Europe, Canada and long-standing allies in the Indo-Pacific.

Trump’s recent comments about taking control of Greenland from NATO member Denmark and insults hurled at various leaders were particularly unnerving, leading many in Europe to question the value of the U.S. as an ally and partner.

That leaves Rubio with a heavy lift if he wants to calm the waters.

Vance's speech last year was “really a shock moment,” said Claudia Major, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “It was perceived as the first very clear statement of what the new Trump administration was about," namely that “Europeans are not partners any longer.”

“There is a big doubt whether the basis (of trust) is still there and whether we still share the same vision for the trans-Atlantic relationship,” she said. “The longer this kind of estrangement goes, the more difficult it will be to re-find a solid relationship.”

Munich Security Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger offered a similar view.

“Transatlantic relations are currently in a significant crisis of confidence and credibility,” he said this week. But he also expressed hope that Rubio and the dozens of U.S. lawmakers expected to attend the meeting will offer a less dire and dour prognosis for the future.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whom Rubio will meet Friday, has tried to adopt a middle line to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and insistence on transactional relations.

He said Europe also needs to “learn the language of power politics” to assert itself, for example, by taking greater responsibility for its security, striving for greater “technological independence” and boosting its economic growth. But he stressed that “as democracies, we are partners and allies and not subordinates” of the U.S.

Some, like French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, appear to have all but given up on Trump and the United States. Both Canada and France opened consulates in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, last week in a show of support for both Greenland and Denmark.

Macron warned this week that tensions between Europe and the U.S. could intensify after the recent “Greenland moment.” He described the Trump administration as “openly anti-European” and seeking the European Union’s “dismemberment."

“When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” he said in an interview with several European newspapers. “I think we’ve tried that strategy for months. It’s not working.”

Macron noted a “double crisis: We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side.”

Carney — who drew applause from many for pushing back against Trump in a speech last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland — has made no secret of his frustration and impatience with the Republican president.

Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. He vowed to pursue trade deals with countries other than the U.S., including China, to serve as anchors of commercial stability. The China deal drew new threats from Trump.

For many in Europe, Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland exacerbate their fears over Russia’s war with Ukraine and serve as a reminder of centuries of power politics in which diplomacy was subordinate to the use of military force.

“Greenland is to Trump as, essentially, Ukraine is to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, although obviously without the devastating war at this stage,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term in office.

In the meantime, as Trump tries to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and seek a nuclear deal with Iran, Europeans are increasingly uneasy about Trump’s “Board of Peace,” a 27-member group of world leaders tasked first with handling the Gaza peace agreement but eventually envisaged as a vehicle for resolving other major conflicts.

Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden, among others, have either declined to accept or have not yet signed on to the board, which will hold its first meeting to raise money for Gaza in Washington on Feb. 19.

Text: Sixteen years after the German Bakery bomb blast in Pune, the trial against alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) terror operative Mohammed Ahmed Zarar Siddibappa alias Yasin Bhatkal (43), one of the key accused in this case, is still on before a special court in Pune.

A high intensity bomb blast at the German Bakery in Koregaon Park area of Pune city, left 17 persons dead and 56 others injured, on the evening of February 13, 2010. In his confession recorded before a court in Kukatpally (in Telangana) in October 2013, Yasin mentioned his role in the German Bakery blast.

As per the confession statement, Yasin hails from Bhatkal in Karnataka. His father, while doing garments and shoes business in Dubai, visited Bhatkal once in three months.

It is stated that Yasin, religious since childhood, failed in SSCL (Class 10 board exams). Initially, he started a business of “garments (Lungi)” in Mumbai in 2001, but within four months, shifted to Bhatkal, where he sold perfumes for about three years.

Some college students like Fasih Mahmood (who later allegedly became an IM operative) often visited Yasin’s perfume shop. Lectures and discussions on jihad and communal violence, were held at the shop, police said.

Between 2004 and 2006, Yasin went to Dubai for a “job in construction” and a business in sports goods. As per Yasin’s confession, around 2004, he met IM founders Riyaz Bhatkal and Iqbal Bhatkal in Mumbai. Yasin did “Jadi Bhooti” business with Bhatkal brothers. Yasin stated how he once admonished Iqbal for buying a motorcycle on a bank loan, as it was against Islam.

As per Riyaz’s instructions, Yasin went to Pakistan in December 2005 for a training of about 50 days in firearms and explosives like TNT (Trinitrotoluene) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Then he went to Dubai, where he started a “personality training educational institute”, it is stated.

Investigators believe that IM was founded around this period. About his association with IM, Yasin stated that he joined an “Usaba”, headed by Iqbal Bhatkal. “Usaba means a group of men who are more than 11 and less than 40… the said Usaba (congregation) is an Arabic word and established in 2005. The main object of Usaba is to collect the persons having the same mentality and dedication to do something.” he stated.

Yasin returned to India from Dubai in 2007. He stayed at a farmhouse in Koppa in Karnataka for a year, when Riyaz asked him to experiment with a “bomb”.

In his confession, Yasin stated how during March 2008, he prepared “Claymore IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) getting inspired by a Hollywood movie. Yasin also stated how the IM members took a house on rent in Pune, kept changing their locations, while IEDs prepared by him were used for various terror attacks in the country, before his arrest from the India- Nepal border in Bihar, on August 28, 2013

Previously, the Kolkata police had arrested Yasin in December 2009 in an arms dealing case. Yasin stated that after coming out of jail, he along with Qateel Siddiqui and others wanted to take revenge. “Accordingly we blasted German Bakery, Pune on 31.2.2010,” he stated.

The Maharashtra ATS arrested Yasin in German Bakery case on March 14, 2014 and filed a chargesheet against him in August same year. Investigators believe that Yasin is visible in the CCTV footage of the blast day obtained from the German bakery premises during the probe. The trial against Yasin is on before a special court in Pune court.

A special NIA court awarded death sentence to Yasin, along with IM member Ajaz Shaikh, a BPO staffer from Pune, for Hyderabad twin blasts on February 21, 2013. The court order stated that Ajaz had allegedly delivered the explosives for bombing the German Bakery to Yasin. But the ATS probe made no mention of Ajaz.

A Delhi police probe into the arrest of alleged IM operative Qateel Siddiqui in November 2011, revealed he conducted a recce of the German Bakery along with Yasin. The ATS had later arrested Siddiqui for his alleged plan to bomb the Dagdusheth Ganpati temple on February 13, 2010, same day when German Bakery was attacked. However, Siddqui was murdered by Pune gangster Sharad Mohol at the Yerwada jail in June 2012. Mohol was shot dead by a gang member in January 2024.

The ATS probe

The ATS had filed a charge sheet against seven persons – Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Bhatkal, Yasin Bhatkal, Mohsin Choudhari of IM and alleged Lashkar E Taiba (LeT) operatives Himayat Baig. Fayyaz Kagzi, Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal of Beed district, in German Bakery case.

On April 18, 2013, a Pune court granted death penalty to Baig, who was arrested by the ATS in September 2010. In May 2016, the Bombay High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. But, Yasin’s confession says nothing about Baig.

Jundal, alleged to be involved in 26/11 Mumbai attack, was deported from Saudi Arabia to India on June 25, 2012. He has not yet been arrested in the German Bakery case. Riyaz, Iqbal and Mohsin, a Pune resident, are absconding. Fayyaz Kagzi is known to have blown himself up outside the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 4, 2016.

Text: Pothole-related road accident fatalities have seen a significant upward trend over the last five years (2020-2024), except a slight dip in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic period. Uttar Pradesh accounts for most road deaths due to potholes.

According to the latest data tabled by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, deaths due to potholes increased by over 53% since 2020.

A total of 1,555 persons died in 2020 in pothole-related road accidents, which increased to 2,385 fatalities in 2024. This translates into over six road deaths due to potholes daily. Except for the minor decrease of about 4.7% between 2020 and 2021, the numbers rose sharply in the subsequent years. A total of 9,438 people died in pothole-related accidents in the last five years.

The number of road accidents due to potholes also increased in the same proportion. The data shows that a total of 3,713 such accidents were recorded in 2020, which increased to 5,432 accidents in 2024. In total, 23,056 accidents caused by potholes were reported over the five-year period. The data includes accidents caused due to potholes on all roads, including national highways, state highways and urban roads.

Last week, a 25-year-old biker died in Delhi’s Janakpuri after falling into an excavation pit.

Pothole-related injuries also increased — from 3,167 in 2020 to 4,643 in 2024 — over the last five years. While there was a slight decrease in 2021 to 3,103, total injuries peaked significantly in 2023 at 5,309.

The data shows grievous injuries rose by approximately 34% during this period, from 1,672 in 2020 to 2,238 in 2024. Minor injuries saw a higher increase of 61%, rising from 1,495 to 2,405. Overall, a total of 9,670 people suffered grievous injuries and 10,286 persons minor injury in these accidents.

Most deaths in UP

The state-wise analysis of the data shows Uttar Pradesh alone contributed more than half of the national total of pothole deaths. The state consistently reported the highest number of fatalities in the country — from 759 deaths in 2020 to 1,369 in 2024.

Madhya Pradesh saw a notable increase in fatalities from 96 in 2020 to 277 in 2024. This was followed by Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Assam. The top five states put together account for over 82% of the total road accident fatalities due to potholes.

In terms of number of annual road accident fatalities, India tops globally, followed by China, which accounts for just 36% of India’s total, and the US at 25%. India has the second-largest road network in the world — about 63.45 lakh km, including 1.46 lakh km of NHs and 1.80 lakh km of state highways. A total of 1.77 lakh people died in road accidents in 2024, an increase of 2.31% from 2023, when 1.73 lakh fatalities were recorded in 4.8 lakh road accidents.

Text: Chinese dictator Xi Jinping sent a video holiday greeting to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Wednesday. In the course of wishing his forces a happy Lunar New Year, he casually confirmed the existence of a Chinese cyberwarfare facility on Fiery Cross Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.

The big revelation came when Xi essentially gave a shout-out to the PLA Cyberspace Force and received a salute in return from the intelligence section chief and Chinese Communist Party political officer stationed on Fiery Cross Reef.

“We shall remain constantly ready for action, resolutely safeguarding our nation’s outpost in the South China Sea,” the section chief chirped.

“Fulfil your assigned duties well, particularly to ensure the coordinated management of soldiers’ work and living conditions,” Xi responded.

The very existence of the Cyberspace Force was not publicly confirmed until last September, when the unit participated in the Victory Day parade in Beijing, China’s annual celebration of victory in World War II. Military analysts believe the Cyberspace Force was formally incorporated as a distinct unit of the PLA in 2024, but it has kept a very low profile until now.

Fiery Cross Reef, which China refers to as Yongshu Jiao, is located in the Spratly Islands, which China calls the Nansha Islands.

Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan also have claims in the Spratlys, but China took the islands and reefs by force in defiance of international tribunal rulings, artificially expanding the smaller features until they were large enough to support permanent installations. Beijing has long claimed these buildings were harmless marine research facilities. Environmentalists say these island-building projects have caused tremendous damage to the local ecosystem.

The equipment showcased by the PLA Cyberspace Force at the 2025 Victory Day parade suggested the unit has a focus on battlefield intelligence and drone countermeasures, which is a disturbing prospect for the hotly contested South China Sea.

Satellite imagery analyzed by the Asia Maritime Transparency Institute (AMTI) in late January showed that China is preparing to militarize another feature in the South China Sea, Antelope Reef in the Paracel Islands. The island chain lies only 250 miles east of the Vietnamese coast and was seized from Vietnam during its 1974 war with China.

AMTI said the installations in the Spratlys and Paracels could be used by China to coordinate its latest instrument of maritime control — fleets of hundreds of fishing boats organized into floating “walls” that can stretch over hundreds of miles. Such barriers could play a role in a prospective Chinese blockade or invasion of Taiwan by disrupting shipping lanes and overwhelming defensive surveillance.

In December, AMTI noted major upgrades to the radar systems installed on Fiery Cross and two other reefs. The think tank warned these upgrades could allow Beijing to “contest the use of the electromagnetic spectrum by others in the event of a conflict.”

Text: MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Western countries are deliberately destroying all peaceful means of cooperation in the Arctic, and the work of the Arctic Council has been effectively blocked, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said.

"All peaceful instruments of cooperation are being deliberately destroyed, and the work of the Arctic Council, which was the main international platform for managing the situation in the Arctic and establishing cooperation, has been effectively blocked. In this region, international cooperation is now more necessary than ever," he told Izvestia.

According to the deputy foreign minister, the breakdown in relations is being used to militarize the region and turn it into an arena of direct confrontation. The peaceful architecture of the Arctic, developed over decades, is being dismantled as Western countries disregard years of constructive interaction, Grushko said.

"Suddenly, they all started talking about how the Arctic is not a zone of reduced tension. Now it has also been declared an arena of confrontation where they - I mean NATO and the European Union - want to confront not only Russia, which is allegedly militarizing the region, but also China," he concluded.

FUKUOKA (Kyodo) -- Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture, the Fisheries Agency said early Friday.

The incident in the waters off southwestern Japan marks the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat, coming at a time when diplomatic relations between Japan and China have remained strained for months under the leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Zheng Nianli, the 47-year-old Chinese skipper of the fishing boat, was arrested Thursday and stands accused of trying to evade an onboard inspection by a Japanese fisheries control officer about 170 kilometers southwest of the island of Meshima in Goto, Nagasaki.

According to the agency's regional office, the vessel had a crew of 11 and is described as a "tiger net fishing boat," usually known for catching fish such as mackerel and horse mackerel.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a regular press conference on Friday in Tokyo that while an investigation into the case continues, the Japanese government will act "resolutely" through enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal operations by foreign fishing vessels.

The Chinese fishing boat is also the first foreign fishing boat seized by the Japanese Fisheries Agency this year.

The agency conducts onboard inspections and other operations to combat illegal fishing in Japanese waters. Last year, it seized two foreign fishing vessels -- one Taiwanese and one South Korean.

According to its annual report, in 2024 the agency conducted seven onboard inspections, seized a Taiwanese fishing boat and confiscated illegal fishing gear in 18 cases.

Text: 

A couple of weeks ago, I interviewed India's Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri at Energy Week in Goa, India. I was probing, trying to get a former diplomat of 50 years to give me a straight answer on why a U.S.-India trade deal was proving so elusive.

"I'm not trying to dodge you," said Puri, repeating once again that discussions were "at a very advanced stage."

Six days later, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a truce.

On Feb. 2, Trump removed the 25% additional penalty imposed for buying Russian oil, claiming that India had committed to stop these purchases. This claim wasn't reiterated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his post on X, however, and nor was it mentioned in the joint statement issued by the two nations.

But it marked a much-needed reset.

The relationship had hit a low point, said Vasuki Shastry, a senior advisor to geostrategic advisory firm Gatehouse. "They're trying to desperately reset. India wants stability, the U.S. doesn't want to lose India. This is the halfway house solution, the off-ramp for both."

In all the months since Trump shocked India by imposing the penalty for purchasing Russian oil, the nation didn't stop buying, nor did it say it would.

India imports 85-90% of its crude oil. Pre-Covid, India wasn't importing much from Russia, but the purchases ramped up nearly 40% following the Ukraine war, primarily due to the discount on offer.

Post Trump's 25% penalty, particularly in the past two months, that number has been inching downwards toward the 20% mark, according to data and analytics firm Kpler.

In the nine days since Trump's claim, neither India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal nor the Foreign Ministry has confirmed it. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said India's energy policy would be determined as always by availability and pricing considerations.

Shastry told me that energy is a national security issue and the Foreign Ministry statement was "absolutely on target."

And then came another reveal: the U.S. revising its fact sheet on the trade deal.

It removed "pulses" from a list of products it said India would reduce or remove tariffs on, and replaced the word "committed" to say that India "intends" to make $500 billion worth of purchases from the U.S. over five years in the agreement.

Talk about collaborative narrative management.

It's this audacity of opacity — that a straight answer isn't needed — that has seen observers suggest this is a decision to remain "strategically ambiguous."

"This is the best way for India," said the former Indian trade negotiator and founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, Ajay Srivastava.

Shastry goes one step further. He believes India and the U.S. have together made the trade-off: let us be labelled opaque rather than losing face.

"There was an urgency in Washington since India concluded the mother of all deals [with the EU]. The real question is what is the actual understanding between the U.S. and India," he said.

It's notable that India and the U.S. have only struck an interim deal so far. The negotiations for the full bilateral trade agreement are yet to be completed. Goyal told Indian reporters: "A formal agreement on this deal will take 30-45 days and will be signed in March."

It's unclear, however, what India's silence on buying Russian oil means for these negotiations. Will it be the elephant in the room with the potential to crush the negotiating table?

"There must be some understanding on this, an internal decision that is not being conveyed," Srivastava said.

The possibility of backchannel talks with Russia also cannot be dismissed. India's historic dependence on Russia for its defence needs cannot be overstated.

Shortly after Trump's executive order that India had "committed to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil," the Kremlin's spokesperson chimed in to say, "we haven't heard any statements from Delhi on this matter yet."

It brought to mind the famous quote by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill about Russia: "a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma."

So can Russia ever be counted out?

"I don't see India stopping to buy Russian oil," said Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler. "Flows will continue, but we won't see a level of 2 million barrels per day, or 40%. It will slowly move from the 20% or so it is now to 15% and I don't see it going lower than that."

He argues that the Indian refiner Nayara Energy, in particular, will continue buying Russian oil. It is majority-owned by Russian entities, including the U.S.-sanctioned Rosneft.

For now, the markets are happy there is a deal, says Vivek Sharma, head of international business at Nuvama Asset Services & Nuvama Private. "The politics might be consuming the narrative, but it'll die down. India's been smart to remain ambiguous, remaining aligned with the U.S., without jeopardising its relationship with Russia."

Sharma said that as the cost of oil is likely to keep falling or remain low, India will be able to reduce its share of Russian oil — all while saying it is following market forces rather than a U.S. diktat.

Kpler's Ritolia believes the decline in India's Russian oil purchases won't have much of an impact on its import bill or global oil prices because a "trade shuffle" will occur."China will buy that Russian oil which India won't, and for that it will have to let go of some other market, maybe The Middle East, which India would buy from. The Dubai pricing complex will get a bit of a premium."The larger concern for the oil market, analysts say, is the possibility of a U.S. and Iran conflict.

Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra, talks about India's AI ambitions and explores the options for labor and language in the country. He says India will continue to be an AI talent factory.

Feroze Azeez of Anand Rathi weighs in on India's equity fund flows. According to industry data, Gold ETFs attracted more money than equities. Azeez says many HNIs chased a metals rally and fell for a "FOMO trap."

Aberdeen's James Thom says India's U.S. trade deal lifts a key overhang, improving sentiment after months of underperformance. He sees easier liquidity, stable policy and stronger earnings supporting a market recovery.

India's central bank on Friday kept its policy rates steady, as trade deals with the E.U. and the U.S. are set to support the world's fastest-growing large economy. "Successful completion of trade deals augurs well" for overall economic outlook, said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

New Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said, signaling the country's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.

I think the government has done well to protect the import of soybean and maize, because these are the two commodities which the U.S. was exporting to China in very large quantity.

— Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary of India

Indian stocks slid amid mixed trading in the region on Thursday. The Nifty 50 declined 0.4%, breaking a four-session winning streak. The index is down more than 1% so far this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked up slightly to around 6.709%.

The rupee strengthened 0.16% to 90.58 against the dollar. The currency has weakened around 0.8% against the greenback since the start of the year.

Text: The Supreme Court Can’t Stop Trade Rebalancing — Even if It Tries

The legal establishment in Washington has convinced itself that the Supreme Court is about to ride to the rescue of the global trade status quo. Lawyers at white-shoe firms are telling their multinational clients to hold tight: the courts will strike down the President’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and the whole trade rebalancing project will collapse.

They’re wrong. Not because the Justices won’t strike down the tariffs. They might. But because the administration has a path forward that doesn’t depend on tariff authority at all, one that rests on powers the statute expressly grants in plain English, and one that may actually be more effective than tariffs at forcing surplus countries to the table.

Here’s the thing the trade establishment doesn’t want to think about: IEEPA doesn’t just let the president regulate imports. It lets him prohibit them. And it lets him issue licenses as exceptions to that prohibition. Those aren’t implied powers or creative readings. They’re right there in the text of the law: the president may “prevent or prohibit” importation and may act “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise.”

That language points to a mechanism that could reshape the global trade landscape even if every tariff the administration has imposed gets struck down tomorrow.

The concept isn’t even new. Back in 2003, Warren Buffett proposed an import certificate system in the pages of Fortune magazine. Buffett’s insight was that persistent trade deficits represented a slow transfer of American wealth to foreign hands — what he called a national “squandering” of assets — and that the solution was to require certificates that authorized importation.

Buffett’s version would have issued certificates to American exporters, who could then sell them to importers on a secondary market. The idea attracted bipartisan interest — Senators Byron Dorgan and Russell Feingold introduced the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2006 based on the concept, but it never made it to a vote.

The proposal described here — call it I-ACES, the Import Authorization Certificate Exchange System — takes Buffett’s core insight and improves on it in a critical way. Instead of creating a domestic market in certificates between American exporters and importers, I-ACES sells the certificates directly to foreign governments. That single change solves the political problem that has dogged the tariff debate from the beginning.

For years, critics of the administration’s trade program have hammered one talking point above all others: “Americans pay the tariffs, not foreign countries.” Set aside that this claim has been badly undermined by the actual data; import prices have not surged the way the models predicted. The deeper problem with the critique is political, not empirical. It gives opponents a simple, repeatable line that resonates even when it’s misleading.

I-ACES eliminates that line of attack entirely.

Under this system, Treasury offers to sell Import Authorization Certificates directly to the governments of countries running bilateral trade surpluses with the United States. The purchase price equals a percentage — 20 to 50 percent — of the country’s prior-year bilateral surplus. The foreign government pays Treasury. That’s the transaction. There is no ambiguity about who is writing the check.

Take Germany. Assume Germany exported $150 billion to the United States last year and imported $100 billion from us, running a $50 billion surplus. Under I-ACES, Treasury offers Germany’s government certificates authorizing imports for one year. At a 20 percent rate, the price is $10 billion — paid by the German government to the United States Treasury.

Germany then has three choices. Pay for continued access. Accept the loss of access to U.S. markets. Or open its market so that its people start buying more American goods to shrink the surplus and lower the certificate price in future years. Every one of those outcomes is a win for the United States. And in every scenario, it is the foreign government making the decision and bearing the cost.

Here’s the part that makes I-ACES elegant in its simplicity: the United States doesn’t care how a foreign government pays for its certificates or how it distributes them.

Maybe Germany charges its exporters directly, passing along the cost of market access. Maybe it funds the purchase through general tax revenue. Maybe it borrows the money. Maybe it auctions the certificates to its own exporters and lets the market determine allocation. Maybe it subsidizes its most strategic industries and makes the rest fend for themselves.

That’s entirely a matter of sovereign discretion. The U.S. transaction is clean: Treasury sells certificates to a foreign government, the foreign government pays. What happens on the other side of that transaction is that country’s domestic policy choice. The United States sets the terms of access. Foreign governments decide how to meet them.

This is a feature, not a bug. It means the U.S. government doesn’t have to design or administer a complex allocation system. It doesn’t have to pick winners and losers among foreign industries. It doesn’t have to monitor how certificates are distributed or fight about pass-through rates. One transaction per country per year. The rest of the world decides how and to whom the export licenses are distributed domestically.

Now, the inevitable objection: isn’t this just a tariff by another name?

Fortunately, that’s not an objection that the federal courts will be able to make if they knock down the IEEPA tariffs as a tax unauthorized by the statute. The Trump administration argued that the plain language authorizing an import ban and licenses should also allow for a tariff as a lesser restriction. If the court rejects this because it insists on the legal gravity of a distinction between licenses and tariffs, it cannot then turn around and say the licenses are effectively tariffs.

In other words, a court that insists on the distinction between a ban-and-license regime and tariffs cannot also claim the licenses are tariffs.

The price of the licenses can be negotiated just as the tariff levels have. If a country agrees to make joint-venture-like investments in the U.S., perhaps it gets a lower license fee. If it insists on buying Russian oil, the license fee goes up. All of the leverage the Trump administration has achieved through tariff diplomacy is still available through import license diplomacy.

I-ACES also dramatically simplifies enforcement. Instead of checking prices on millions of imported goods and assessing tariffs, you have one number per country per year. Customs and Border Protection simply checks to see if the country has purchased an import license. The Commerce Department assesses the prices of the I-ACES license by looking at the amount of the country’s trade imbalance, based on a calculation it already performs each year. That’s cleaner than anything in the current tariff system.

The broader point is one the legal and economic establishment has consistently failed to grasp throughout this administration’s trade program. The persistent bilateral trade deficits the United States runs with dozens of countries are not natural features of a healthy global economy. They represent decades of institutional and policy choices by surplus countries — currency management, industrial subsidies, market barriers — that have systematically transferred income and productive capacity out of the United States. Buffett saw this more than 20 years ago. The economics profession mostly shrugged.

Standard economic theory says these imbalances should self-correct. Deficit countries should eventually run surpluses as the accumulated claims get spent. In practice, that correction has never come. China, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and others have maintained enormous surpluses with America for decades. When economists are called upon to explain this persistent violation of economic theory, the response has been a shrug.

The Administration is not shrugging. And if the Supreme Court takes away one tool, the statutory text provides another. The lawyers and economists who are counting on the courts to restore the old order should prepare themselves for disappointment. The president has more options than they think, and the law is clearer than they’d like.

President Trump is holding an ace in his hand. If the courts nix the tariffs, he’ll still have the winning trick.

Text: Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz greeted the press together on arrival at the Alden Biesen Castle, with Macron saying they shared a "sense of urgency" on economic reform. But the two may clash on the way forward.

Heads of state and government from the EU gathered at an "informal retreat" at the Alden Biesen Castle in eastern Belgium on Thursday, in lieu of a full monthly leaders' summit in Brussels.

The talks will focus on reviving and streamlining Europe's economy, with the leaders also set to discuss ways to counter threats from China, Russia and the US.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sought to emphasize their areas of agreement while talking to reporters on arrival. This follows extensive media coverage on differences between the heads of the EU's two biggest economies as the bloc tries to remain competitive on the world stage.

"We want to speed up the European Union, we want to make it better, and we want to ensure that we have a competitive industry in Europe," Merz said standing by Macron's side.

"I believe we share this sense of urgency, that our Europe must take very clear action," Macron said.


The French and German leaders have so far outlined rather different visions of how to best achieve a more competitive business landscape within the EU.

Merz has been calling for the removal of red tape and regulations, reduced reporting requirements for businesses, reduced trade barriers between EU countries and for more international free trade agreements.

Macron, on the other hand, has called for issuing more pooled joint debt underwritten by the bloc as a whole, an idea Germany opposes.

"We have taken on European debt in exceptional situations — but those were exceptional situations," Merz said after the talks.

France has also vocally opposed the recently-agreed free trade deal between the EU and four Latin American countries, following widespread protests from French farmers. In turn, Merz criticized the last-minute delay to the deal's implementation in the European Parliament.

Macron hinted that Germany and France were moving closer together on one issue — harmonizing capital markets across the EU — in comments to reporters on Thursday. The European Commission recently proposed streamlining national rules to create a so-called savings and investment union, an old idea that run into obstacles in the past.

Belgian ‌Prime Minister ​Bart De Wever, who is hosting the summit, called for a focus on affordable power for industry at the meeting.

"The main issue for European industry right now is energy costs," Belgian ‌Prime Minister ​Bart De Wever said.

The power prices for European industry are more than double those in the US and China.

"We are not competitive and we risk losing the petrochemical industry, the steel industry, metals, and of course, this is the base of all prosperity," De Wever said.

Other leaders voiced frustration at the pace of change.

"There's so much talk and so little action, and this is a chance to reverse that trend," Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.

Czech Prime Minsiter Andrej Babis also lamented: "Only words, conferences, no action."

However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen struck a more optimistic note.

"The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains," she said.

On the eve of the retreat near Rijkhoven, leading European industry representatives called on EU leaders to take on the bloc's economic challenges with a greater urgency.

"We urge you to move from diagnosis to delivery, and from plans to results, with a single objective: Save our industry. Not next year, not next week, but today," a joint industry statement read.

Macron said that the EU should look to meet a June deadline of either reaching a consensus among its 27 member states, or possibly of forging ahead in a smaller group if necessary.

"We need to act fast and we need concrete decisions by June," the French president said. "If, in certain areas, we are not advancing as 27, we have the right to opt for reinforced cooperation [among fewer EU members] to go faster."

Text: Louis Vuitton’s Dutch business has agreed to pay 500,000 euros in an out-of-court settlement after prosecutors linked the fashion house and luxury goods maker to a money laundering case

THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Dutch branch of French-based luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton has agreed to pay half a million euros ($595,000) in an out-of-court settlement linked to a money laundering investigation, the Netherlands' national public prosecution office announced Thursday.

Prosecutors said the fashion house did not adhere to a law aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorism financing when a 36-year-old woman allegedly repeatedly used different names as she spent cash “on luxury goods at retailers such as Louis Vuitton.” The woman is suspected of spending more than 2 million euros in criminal proceeds from August 2021 to February 2023.

“Louis Vuitton violated the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention) Act ... and did not do enough to prevent money laundering by its customers. For an extended period, the company failed to properly identify the customers who repeatedly came to spend large sums of cash," the prosecutors' statement said.

A spokesperson at Louis Vuitton's head office in Paris did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Prosecutors alleged that after buying luxury handbags, the woman sent them to China to be resold to make it look like the proceeds came from legitimate trade.

A money laundering case is ongoing against the woman and two other suspects, including a former sales assistant at Louis Vuitton in the Netherlands. The assistant is alleged to have tipped off the woman when new and expensive bags came into stock and warned her if her spending exceeded limits that would require Louis Vuitton to alert authorities about suspect payments.

The settlement with the Dutch arm of Louis Vuitton was reached out of court “to free up limited courtroom space at the Rotterdam District Court,” prosecutors said.

Text: SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that it believes the teenage daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader as he moves to extend the family dynasty to a fourth generation.

The assessment by the National Intelligence Service comes as North Korea is preparing to hold its biggest political conference later this month, where Kim is expected to outline his major policy goals for the next five years and take steps to tighten his authoritarian grip.

In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.

First appearing in public at a long-range missile test in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has since accompanied her father to an increasing number of events, including weapons tests, military parades and factory openings.

She traveled with him to Beijing last September for Kim’s first summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in six years on the sidelines of a World War II event.

Speculation about her political future intensified last month when she joined her parents on a New Year’s Day visit to Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a sacred family mausoleum displaying the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather, the country’s first- and second-generation leaders.

Some experts saw the visit as the clearest sign yet that she’s positioned to be the heir to her 42-year-old father.

South Korean officials initially expressed doubt that she could be chosen as a North Korean leader, citing the country’s deeply conservative culture and tradition of male-dominated leadership. But her increasingly prominent appearances in state media have prompted a reassessment.

In its previous assessment of Kim Ju Ae’s status in September, the NIS told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un’s decision to bring her along on his trip to China was likely part of an effort to build a “narrative” possibly paving the way for her succession.

“In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that’s quite significant,” Lee said.

According to Lee, the agency cited her growing presence at high-profile military events, her inclusion in the family visit to Kumsusan, and signs that Kim Jong Un was beginning to seek her input on certain policy matters.

Despite her increased visibility in propaganda, North Korean state media have never published the name of Kim Jong Un’s daughter, only referring to her as his “respected” or “most beloved” child.

The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA star Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding Kim Jong Un’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013. South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born sometime that year.

In 2023, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un and his wife also likely have an older son and a younger third child whose gender is unknown.

Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been ruled by male members of the Kim family, beginning with the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and followed by his son, Kim Jong Il.

Kim Jong Un was just 26 when he was officially named heir during a 2010 party conference, two years after Kim Jong Il suffered a debilitating stroke.

Following his father’s death in December 2011, he was abruptly thrust into the throne with relatively little preparation.





Some analysts suggest that Kim Jong Un’s decision to debut his daughter early possibly reflects his own experience of being rushed into power.

Kim Ju Ae’s first known visit to Kumsusan last month was also her father’s first visit to the site in three years.

Given the palace’s status as a key symbol of the Kim family rule, the trip should be seen as a symbolic gesture by Kim Jong Un to present his daughter as his heir before his grandfather and father as he prepares for the major ruling party congress, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.

The Workers’ Party congress in late February, last held in 2016 and 2021, could provide a stage for Kim Jong Un to formalize his succession plans, possibly by giving his daughter the party’s first secretary post, its No. 2 job, although such a decision might not be immediately disclosed to the outside world, Cheong said.

Other analysts question whether she would receive such a high-profile post or any formal party role, given that party rules require members to be at least 18.

If Kim Jong Un does use the party congress to cement his daughter as successor, the signs would be more subtle, said Koh Yu-hwan, former president of South Korea’s Institute of National Unification.

For example, the party may issue self-praise about how North Korea has survived longer than most other Communist states and credit that to how the country established a “successful inheritance of the revolution,” he said.

“If you see comments like that, it would be reasonable to think that Ju Ae has been cemented,” as heir, Koh said.

Text: Japanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.

The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.

"The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled," the fisheries agency said.

The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement.

There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said.

Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a "tiger net fishing boat" with a high capacity.

"We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels," Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.

Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.

It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls "reunification".

In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as "egregious", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.

That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.

As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to "stop playing with fire".

Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.

Japan's last two pandas were even returned to China last month.

Zhang Youxia, widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was in January removed from his post.

A woman speaks about how being a transracial adoptee has shaped her life as part of a new podcast.

Japan has been battling sluggish growth, mounting public debt and a rapidly ageing workforce.

A Hong Kong court sentences the 78-year-old British citizen Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison after he was found guilty of national security offences last December.

Lai's supporters say this amounts to a death sentence, but authorities say it demonstrates the rule of law.
