* It follows earlier U.S. pledges (e.g., $11 B in arms sales, $84 B in goods purchases) and Taiwan’s own efforts to deepen trade ties with major partners.  
* The agreement is part of a broader U.S. strategy to strengthen ties with Taiwan in the face of growing Chinese influence.  
* While the U.S. keeps the tariff rate at 15 % for Taiwanese imports, Taiwan’s move to cut 99 % of tariffs on U.S. goods is seen as a significant shift that is likely to influence the region’s trade dynamics.  
**Bottom line:** The pact locks the U.S. duty on Taiwanese goods at 15 %, gives Taiwan a huge tariff break on U.S. goods (up to 99 %), and gives preferential treatment to Taiwanese semiconductors. It also includes sizeable U.S. investment and purchase commitments, and will be finalized once Taiwan’s legislature signs off.
**Key take‑aways from the U.S.–Taiwan trade pact (signed 13 Feb 2026)**  
### Quick context
| **Exempted Taiwanese product categories** | **2,072** Taiwanese product categories will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs. Within that, **261** agricultural categories (Phalaenopsis orchids, tea, starch, coffee, mangoes, etc.) will be exempt from U.S. duties. These 261 categories account for **42 %** of the value of Taiwan’s agricultural exports to the U.S. (≈ $374 M annually). | Exempting high‑value agricultural goods boosts Taiwan’s ag‑exports and signals a deepening of the trade relationship beyond high‑tech. |
| **Legislative review** | The deal will be submitted to Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan for review and approval. | It reflects Taiwan’s internal decision‑making and can be a point of domestic debate (particularly over defense spending), but the trade agreement is already in effect pending approval. |
| **Preferential treatment for Taiwanese semiconductors** | Taiwanese semiconductors and related goods will receive the **most favourable tariff treatment** when exported to the U.S. | This is a targeted effort to protect and support Taiwan’s globally critical semiconductor supply chain, which is a major export driver for the island. |
| **Taiwan’s tariff cuts on U.S. goods** | Taiwan will **eliminate or reduce by up to 99 %** tariff barriers on a wide range of U.S. industrial and agricultural products – including autos, auto parts, chemicals, seafood, medical goods, wheat, beef, dairy, pork, lamb, ketchup, peanuts, etc. | The removal of 99 % of tariffs essentially opens the Taiwanese market to U.S. goods, making Taiwan a more attractive destination for U.S. manufacturers and exporters. |
| **U.S. duties on Taiwanese goods** | US will keep the tariff on most Taiwanese exports at **15 %** (the same level it applies to Japan, South Korea, and the EU). | 15 % is the “Most‑Favoured‑Nation” rate that gives Taiwan parity with the U.S.’s major trade partners and removes the 15 %‑to‑25 % range that has historically applied to many goods from Taiwan. |
| **U.S. investment commitments** | The U.S. has committed up to **$250 B** in investment in Taiwan’s U.S. operations (semiconductors, AI, energy, etc.) and will provide up to an additional **$250 B** in credit guarantees to help Taiwanese firms invest in the U.S. | This creates a “two‑way” relationship: Taiwan gains access to U.S. markets, and the U.S. gains a partner for reshoring critical technologies. |
| **U.S. purchases of Taiwanese goods** | The U.S. plans to buy **$84 B** worth of Taiwanese goods between 2025‑2029 (liquefied natural gas, crude oil, aircraft, power equipment, etc.). | These purchases diversify the U.S. supply base and reduce dependence on China for certain high‑tech and energy products. |
