Text: The Supreme Court Can’t Stop Trade Rebalancing — Even if It Tries

The legal establishment in Washington has convinced itself that the Supreme Court is about to ride to the rescue of the global trade status quo. Lawyers at white-shoe firms are telling their multinational clients to hold tight: the courts will strike down the President’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and the whole trade rebalancing project will collapse.

They’re wrong. Not because the Justices won’t strike down the tariffs. They might. But because the administration has a path forward that doesn’t depend on tariff authority at all, one that rests on powers the statute expressly grants in plain English, and one that may actually be more effective than tariffs at forcing surplus countries to the table.

Here’s the thing the trade establishment doesn’t want to think about: IEEPA doesn’t just let the president regulate imports. It lets him prohibit them. And it lets him issue licenses as exceptions to that prohibition. Those aren’t implied powers or creative readings. They’re right there in the text of the law: the president may “prevent or prohibit” importation and may act “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise.”

That language points to a mechanism that could reshape the global trade landscape even if every tariff the administration has imposed gets struck down tomorrow.

The concept isn’t even new. Back in 2003, Warren Buffett proposed an import certificate system in the pages of Fortune magazine. Buffett’s insight was that persistent trade deficits represented a slow transfer of American wealth to foreign hands — what he called a national “squandering” of assets — and that the solution was to require certificates that authorized importation.

Buffett’s version would have issued certificates to American exporters, who could then sell them to importers on a secondary market. The idea attracted bipartisan interest — Senators Byron Dorgan and Russell Feingold introduced the Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 2006 based on the concept, but it never made it to a vote.

The proposal described here — call it I-ACES, the Import Authorization Certificate Exchange System — takes Buffett’s core insight and improves on it in a critical way. Instead of creating a domestic market in certificates between American exporters and importers, I-ACES sells the certificates directly to foreign governments. That single change solves the political problem that has dogged the tariff debate from the beginning.

For years, critics of the administration’s trade program have hammered one talking point above all others: “Americans pay the tariffs, not foreign countries.” Set aside that this claim has been badly undermined by the actual data; import prices have not surged the way the models predicted. The deeper problem with the critique is political, not empirical. It gives opponents a simple, repeatable line that resonates even when it’s misleading.

I-ACES eliminates that line of attack entirely.

Under this system, Treasury offers to sell Import Authorization Certificates directly to the governments of countries running bilateral trade surpluses with the United States. The purchase price equals a percentage — 20 to 50 percent — of the country’s prior-year bilateral surplus. The foreign government pays Treasury. That’s the transaction. There is no ambiguity about who is writing the check.

Take Germany. Assume Germany exported $150 billion to the United States last year and imported $100 billion from us, running a $50 billion surplus. Under I-ACES, Treasury offers Germany’s government certificates authorizing imports for one year. At a 20 percent rate, the price is $10 billion — paid by the German government to the United States Treasury.

Germany then has three choices. Pay for continued access. Accept the loss of access to U.S. markets. Or open its market so that its people start buying more American goods to shrink the surplus and lower the certificate price in future years. Every one of those outcomes is a win for the United States. And in every scenario, it is the foreign government making the decision and bearing the cost.

Here’s the part that makes I-ACES elegant in its simplicity: the United States doesn’t care how a foreign government pays for its certificates or how it distributes them.

Maybe Germany charges its exporters directly, passing along the cost of market access. Maybe it funds the purchase through general tax revenue. Maybe it borrows the money. Maybe it auctions the certificates to its own exporters and lets the market determine allocation. Maybe it subsidizes its most strategic industries and makes the rest fend for themselves.

That’s entirely a matter of sovereign discretion. The U.S. transaction is clean: Treasury sells certificates to a foreign government, the foreign government pays. What happens on the other side of that transaction is that country’s domestic policy choice. The United States sets the terms of access. Foreign governments decide how to meet them.

This is a feature, not a bug. It means the U.S. government doesn’t have to design or administer a complex allocation system. It doesn’t have to pick winners and losers among foreign industries. It doesn’t have to monitor how certificates are distributed or fight about pass-through rates. One transaction per country per year. The rest of the world decides how and to whom the export licenses are distributed domestically.

Now, the inevitable objection: isn’t this just a tariff by another name?

Fortunately, that’s not an objection that the federal courts will be able to make if they knock down the IEEPA tariffs as a tax unauthorized by the statute. The Trump administration argued that the plain language authorizing an import ban and licenses should also allow for a tariff as a lesser restriction. If the court rejects this because it insists on the legal gravity of a distinction between licenses and tariffs, it cannot then turn around and say the licenses are effectively tariffs.

In other words, a court that insists on the distinction between a ban-and-license regime and tariffs cannot also claim the licenses are tariffs.

The price of the licenses can be negotiated just as the tariff levels have. If a country agrees to make joint-venture-like investments in the U.S., perhaps it gets a lower license fee. If it insists on buying Russian oil, the license fee goes up. All of the leverage the Trump administration has achieved through tariff diplomacy is still available through import license diplomacy.

I-ACES also dramatically simplifies enforcement. Instead of checking prices on millions of imported goods and assessing tariffs, you have one number per country per year. Customs and Border Protection simply checks to see if the country has purchased an import license. The Commerce Department assesses the prices of the I-ACES license by looking at the amount of the country’s trade imbalance, based on a calculation it already performs each year. That’s cleaner than anything in the current tariff system.

The broader point is one the legal and economic establishment has consistently failed to grasp throughout this administration’s trade program. The persistent bilateral trade deficits the United States runs with dozens of countries are not natural features of a healthy global economy. They represent decades of institutional and policy choices by surplus countries — currency management, industrial subsidies, market barriers — that have systematically transferred income and productive capacity out of the United States. Buffett saw this more than 20 years ago. The economics profession mostly shrugged.

Standard economic theory says these imbalances should self-correct. Deficit countries should eventually run surpluses as the accumulated claims get spent. In practice, that correction has never come. China, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and others have maintained enormous surpluses with America for decades. When economists are called upon to explain this persistent violation of economic theory, the response has been a shrug.

The Administration is not shrugging. And if the Supreme Court takes away one tool, the statutory text provides another. The lawyers and economists who are counting on the courts to restore the old order should prepare themselves for disappointment. The president has more options than they think, and the law is clearer than they’d like.

President Trump is holding an ace in his hand. If the courts nix the tariffs, he’ll still have the winning trick.

Text: The Supreme Court order to examine Khan comes after his attorney told media that the former prime minister had lost most of his vision in his right eye. Khan has been in prison since 2023 due to a graft case conviction.

Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday said the Pakistani government must form a medical team to assess Imran Khan's health, after the imprisoned ex-prime minister reportedly complained of massive vision loss.

Pakistani media reported that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, said "the issue of Imran's health is most important," while adding that "intervention was necessary."

The two-member bench is conducting hearings related to Khan's living conditions in Adiala Jail, which is located in the central-eastern Pakistani province of Punjab.

The court set a February 16 deadline for a medical examination and also said 73-year-old Khan must be allowed contact with his sons, who reside in London.

Khan's attorney, Salman Safdar, met with Khan earlier in the week. Safdar told the Supreme Court that Khan reported vision loss of up to 85% in his right eye due to a blood clot.

Khan's son, Karim Khan, blamed his father's deteriorating health in confinement on "the regime in power, the Army Chief and the puppets enabling their orders, their watch and their responsablity."

"We urge human rights bodies, legal institutions and democratic nations to confront this persecution and ensure those responsible face consequences," Kasim said.


Khan served as Pakistan's prime minister from August 2018 until he was removed via a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022.

A former cricket star, Khan still boasts a massive base of voters and supporters in Pakistan. Khan has blamed the Pakistani military and the US for his removal from power, although Washington denies this allegation.

Khan was put behind bars in 2023 due to his conviction in a graft case. The Pakistani government has also cracked down on Khan's Pakistani Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and pro-PTI protesters.

A U.S. federal judge has ordered the Venezuelan men that the Trump administration deported to El Salvador early last year be returned to the United States, stating that they did not receive due process in some cases.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued the order to bring back 137 Venezuelans on Thursday, citing as precedent the well-documented return of Kilmar Abrego-Gargia from El Salvador’s CECOT prison to the U.S.

The order comes after a hearing on Monday when Boasberg hinted he would order their return. Department of Justice lawyers at the time said they would prefer the Venezuelans return to the U.S. rather than try to do remote hearings from El Salvador, Venezuela or other locations outside the U.S.

Boasberg's order also asked that the government submit a status report by March 13.

The case has emerged as one of the defining court fights of President Donald Trump’s second term, allowing the administration to test its mettle against the federal courts and the practical limits of judicial authority, on one of Trump’s biggest policy priorities.

It's a fight that has also put Boasberg, who is overseeing the Alien Enemies Act case, squarely in the Trump administration's crosshairs as he attempts to determine what due process protections, if any, the administration is legally obligated to provide and how far the courts can go to enforce them.


DOJ lawyers, who have appealed nearly every decision Boasberg has made in this case so far, can appeal Boasberg's latest order.

Donald Trump has reversed a 'crucial' scientific ruling

Donald Trump has reversed a “crucial” scientific ruling that resulted in major reforms by Barack Obama's administration.

The so-called "endangerment finding" by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2009 concluded a range of greenhouse gases was a threat to public health, becoming the legal foundation of federal efforts to rein in emissions.

The EPAy, currently headed by Lee Zeldin, called the reversal the "largest deregulation in American history", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.

Environmental groups say the move is by far the “most significant rollback” on climate change attempted yet and are set to challenge it in the courts.

Mr Obama, the former US President, said: “Today, the Trump administration repealed the endangerment finding: the ruling that served as the basis for limits on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules.

“Without it, we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change - all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”

The EPA first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Mr Obama's first term.

The agency decided six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.

Obama's administration reduced the Federal Government’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 17 percent, and set standards to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr Trump said the ruling was "a disastrous Obama-era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers".

"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history," he said.

Administration officials are stressing overturning the regulation will save more than $1trillion and help cut the price of energy and transport.

It would supposedly reduce automobile manufacturers' spending by $2,400 per vehicle, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being proclaimed by the Trump team.

"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4trillion in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles," said Peter Zalzal, from the Environmental Defense Fund.

"We've also analysed the health impacts, and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks," he added.

While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, such as unleashing suppressed "nuisance" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.

One key argument about the reversal will be about the science on which it is based, with the Department of Energy challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.

A federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.

Many legal experts believe they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Mr Trump's second term ends, believing if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.

The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by Tarique Rahman, secured an emphatic victory in the Bangladesh elections, with a resounding mandate in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the South Asian nation. Leading in over 200 seats in the 300-seat parliament, the party will now form the government with a two-thirds majority, while Jamaat-e-Islami will emerge as the main Opposition party in Bangladesh. This is a remarkable turnaround for a party that had long been a political pariah. These are the first national elections since the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Follow here for the latest updates on the Bangladesh Election Results 2026.


🚨 Big Story

Soon after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey submitted a notice moving a substantive motion against the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, the latter once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over India-US the trade deal, asserting, “do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers” and “will not budge even an inch”. Gandhi’s remarks came a day after he mounted a sharp attack on the government, accusing it of compromising India’s energy security and farm interests in the trade deal. On Thursday, Dubey sought Gandhi’s “immediate expulsion” from the Lower House after initiating an “inquiry to examine all his unethical conduct”.

Then, is the LoP at the risk of being expelled? With the substantive motion moved against Gandhi, all eyes are on what this crucial instrument means. According to M N Kaul’s and S L Shakdher’s authoritative book Practice and Procedure of Parliament, “a substantive motion is a self-contained independent proposal submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a manner as to be capable of expressing a decision of the House.” They are put to a vote so that they express the decision of the House. Here’s what substantive motions mean.

Fallout: Following Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri’s statement that he had met convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “three or four times”, Congress MP and party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Thursday demanded the resignation of the Cabinet Minister. Priyanka alleged that Puri had corresponded with Epstein after the allegations against him were made public. The fresh tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) on January 30 shows that Puri exchanged emails with Epstein in 2014-15. Referring to the documents, Priyanka told The Indian Express, “In my opinion, he should resign.”

“While we are opponents, we are not enemies”.

As the Parliament Budget Session 2026 is underway, our columnist Neerja Chowdhury reflects on the declining parliamentary standards in the country, which has now become “commonplace,” and suggests all MPs should remember BJP leader Sushma Swaraj’s words in 2014, during the last sitting of the 15th Lok Sabha.

In the backdrop of the recent disruptions in the Parliament that have rendered sessions dysfunctional, Chowdhury writes: “The bitterness that has come to vitiate the relationship between the two sides makes dialogue that much more difficult. While the government has to ensure Parliament runs smoothly, it is not possible without the cooperation of the Opposition, or without civility in public discourse, which is becoming a casualty.” Here’s why MPs need to recall Swaraj’s words once again.

📰 From the Front Page

Following a dip in membership and revenue, the legal fraternity, comprising 15 Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court, has now stepped in to save ‘Mohammad’ Deepak’s gym in Kotdwar. Deepak was thrust into the limelight in January when he stood up to a group of men who were harassing a 70-year-old Muslim shopkeeper, suffering from Parkinson’s disease, to drop the word “Baba” from his shop’s name. A video of Deepak calling himself Mohammad Deepak during the confrontation went viral, and he soon began to struggle to sustain his livelihood. The Senior Advocates have pitched in Rs 10,000 each as a one-year membership fee. The move, they said, was inspired by the act of CPI(M) MP John Brittas, who had visited the gym and purchased the membership.

The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) Thursday cleared the long-awaited proposal to buy 114 Rafale fighter jets from France under an inter-governmental deal for the Indian Air Force (IAF), of which 90 jets would be manufactured in India. Led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the DAC has also cleared the procurement of six additional P8I maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft from the US for the Navy. The development comes days before French President Emmanuel Macron’s scheduled visit to India between February 17 and 19.

📌 Must Read

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri Thursday held a meeting with United States Ambassador Sergio Gor in New Delhi, following which the latter confirmed that with the finalisation of the trade deal, many opportunities are poised to open up for partnership between the two countries. This comes on a day when New Delhi has categorically said that the joint statement released by both sides on February 7 remains the basis for the interim trade agreement.

In our Opinion section today, N K Singh takes a deep dive into India’s next steps as the world adjusts to the United States power politics. Singh writes: “A successful negotiation is often said to leave all sides equally dissatisfied. If this agreement raises exports and deepens technical-industrial capability during a disorderly global transition, it is a substantial achievement. It is ironic that a momentous mindset shift is met with prevarication. India is mature enough to seek purposeful engagement with a credible place in the global value added chain. What could have been a moment missed has become a moment seized.”

AI Stack: The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in India largely depends on how our AI applications can help improve the quality of life of our citizens. The Economic Survey 2026 is pragmatic about how India can leverage AI and solve its social and economic problems. Applications in health, agriculture, education, urban management, and disaster preparedness seem to show some promise. Certainly, with the right support, many of these can scale to a pan-India market and, later, can be bundled into an India AI Applications Stack. Take a look at some groundbreaking initiatives.

⏳ And Finally…

The whole of Pakistan is counting on Sahibzada Farhan against India, as both countries gear up to fight it out on Sunday at the Sri Lanka ground. For, Farhan has done what few other batsmen in the world have – to counterpunch Jasprit Bumrah and unsettle him in the first spell. My colleague Venkata Krishna B, who’s in Sri Lanka covering the ICC T20 World Cup, writes: “From 2019 to 2024, Pakistan has witnessed their batsmen crumble against Bumrah. Be it Ahmedabad or New York, Bumrah has cracked open the game with his artistry similar to how Pakistan’s wondrous seamers had subjected Indian batsmen during their good old days. Hence, Farhan’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed.”

🎧 Lastly, don’t forget to tune in to today’s episode of our 3 Things podcast, where we discuss the chaos over an AI-generated video of Himanta that left BJP red-faced; BJD protests in Odisha; as well as India’s latest procurement of 114 Rafale jets, Poseidon 8I maritime surveillance along with anti-submarine warfare aircraft.

That’s all for today. Have a wonderful day!

Until next time,
Ariba

Text: The US has revoked what's known as the endangerment finding, an Obama-era scientific finding central to US actions against climate change. Experts say the shift comes at a fragile point for the warming planet.

In what the White House has described as the "largest deregulatory action in American history," President Donald Trump has undone a key scientific finding that has been the cornerstone of United States efforts to fight climate change for more than 16 years.

Speaking at the White House on Thursday, the president officially rescinded a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. It has served as a key part of the green policies later introduced by former Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

"This determination had no basis in fact, had none whatsoever, and no basis in law," Trump said at the White House on Thursday.

"This was all a scam, a giant scam," he added, dismissing concerns that the repeal could cost lives by worsening climate change.

The landmark scientific finding, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2009, was the legal framework that allowed the EPA to regulate planet-warming emissions seen as a threat to "public health and welfare of current and future generations."

A previous ruling by the Supreme Court gave the agency the authority to enact policies that targeted heat-trapping emissions — carbon dioxide, methane and other pollutants.

The policies first targeted car and truck exhaust, and later expanded to include emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants and the oil and gas industry.

The Trump administration has questioned the science behind the 2009 decision, arguing that the effects of emissions on human health are indirect and that US regulation is insufficient to tackle a global problem.

But scientists and environment experts have widely backed the finding, with the non-profit American Geophysical Union saying it is "grounded in decades of rigorous, peer-reviewed climate science."

Trump and his administration have argued that the EPA's finding gave the federal government too much power, holding back businesses and innovation and raising prices.


"Many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends," said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in July 2025. He said the costs related to greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks had been a "real threat to Americans' livelihoods."

The White House has said undoing the environmental regulation will expand access to affordable, reliable energy. Trump added Thursday that the move would save Americans more than $1.3 trillion by removing regulatory requirements related to vehicle emissions standards, and other related programs.

With the endangerment finding eliminated, the EPA will lose its ability to use the 1963 Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases.

"It represents a complete US step away from renewable energy and energy efficiency in favor of full embrace of expanded production and use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas," Barry Rabe, environmental and public policy professor at the University of Michigan, told DW in July 2025.

The repeal of the endangerment finding will slow efforts to require the US auto industry to sell less-polluting cars and trucks, while curtailing federal support for the growing electric vehicle sector. The previous Biden administration had set a goal to have EVs (electric vehicles) make up at least 50% of new car sales by 2030.

"The transportation sector is the single largest source of US global heat-trapping emissions," said Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization, in a statement on Thursday.

She added: "Ramming through this unlawful, destructive action at the behest of polluters is an obvious example of what happens when a corrupt administration and fossil fuel interests are allowed to run amok."

Environment groups have said the move also risks being extended to a rollback of limits on carbon emissions and other pollutants from power plants and the fossil fuel industry, invalidating nearly all climate regulations. As a result, increased pollutants could worsen air quality and further contribute to the hazardous effects of climate change — deadly heat waves, destructive flood and extreme storms.

The move to loosen EPA oversight comes as an international team of researchers issued an urgent warning this week, saying that the destabilization of Earth's feedback loops could amplify the consequences of global warming after millions of years of a stable climate.

"We're now moving away from that stability and could be entering a period of unprecedented climate change," said William Ripple, ecology professor at Oregon State University in the US, adding that it put Earth at increased risk of a "hothouse" trajectory.

Trump's move to scrap the endangerment finding is just the latest attack on US climate and environmental regulations.

Since beginning his second term in January 2025, the president has withdrawn the US from international climate commitments, including the 2015 Paris Agreement, slashed environmental protections, suppressed climate research and boosted the fossil fuel industry.

Just this week, Trump ordered US military bases and facilities to buy their electricity from power plants fueled by "beautiful clean coal," citing the unreliability of renewable energy.

Critics of Trump's decision, including the Environmental Defense Fund and the non-profit environmental law firm Earthjustice, have said they plan to challenge the move in court, potentially taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court. But that could take years, and until then the endangerment finding — and all the policies it created — will no longer apply.

"People nationwide will pay the price for this illegal action," said Manish Bapna, head of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy group, calling out Trump for giving a "free pass to oil billionaires."

"With no protections in place, climate change will worsen — that means more air pollution, more health problems, higher energy bills, and more extreme storms. Science and the law won't allow it to stand."

While they have welcomed EPA's move, some power companies are worried that rescinding the finding will expose them to a surge of "public nuisance" lawsuits targeting activities that unreasonably interfere with the health and safety of a community.

"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it," Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor, told the Reuters news agency earlier this week.

Mr Trump announced the repeal beside EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 05:25 AM


WASHINGTON -  The administration of President Donald Trump on Feb 12 announced the repeal of a scientific finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, and eliminated federal tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks.

It is the most sweeping climate change policy rollback by the administration to date, after a string of regulatory cuts and other moves intended to unfetter fossil fuel development and stymie the rollout of clean energy.

"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding, a disastrous Obama-era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and drove up prices for American consumers," Mr Trump said, saying it was the biggest deregulatory action in US history.

Mr Trump announced the repeal beside EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House Budget director Russ Vought, who has long sought to revoke the finding and was a key architect of conservative policy blueprint Project 2025.

Mr Trump has said he believes climate change is a "con job", and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement, leaving the world’s largest historic contributor to global warming out of international efforts to combat it in addition to killing Biden-era tax credits aimed at accelerating deployment of electric cars and renewable energy.

Former President Barack Obama blasted the move on X, saying without the endangerment finding, "we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money”.

Mr Zeldin said the Trump administration took on the most consequential climate policy of the last 15 years, something that the agency avoided during his first term amid industry concern about legal and regulatory uncertainty.

"Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated," he said.

The endangerment finding was first adopted by the United States in 2009, and led the EPA to take action under the Clean Air Act of 1963 to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and four other heat-trapping air pollutants from vehicles, power plants and other industries.

It came about after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 in the Massachusetts v EPA case that the agency has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Its repeal would remove the regulatory requirements to measure, report, certify, and comply with federal greenhouse gas emission standards for cars, but may not initially apply to stationary sources such as power plants.

The transportation and power sectors are each responsible for around a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas output, according to EPA figures.

The EPA said the repeal and end of vehicle emission standards will save US taxpayers US$1.3 trillion (S$1.64 trillion), while the prior administration said the rules would have net benefits to consumers through lower fuel costs and other savings.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing major automakers, did not endorse the action but said "automotive emissions regulations finalised in the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace demand for EVs”.

The Environmental Defense Fund said that the repeal will end up costing Americans more, despite EPA's statement that climate regulations have driven up costs for consumers.

"Administrator Lee Zeldin has directed EPA to stop protecting the American people from the pollution that's causing worse storms, floods, and skyrocketing insurance costs," said EDF President Fred Krupp. "This action will only lead to more of this pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families."

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA aimed to cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50 per cent by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels and forecast between 35 per cent and 56 per cent of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric.

The agency then estimated that the rules would result in net benefits of US$99 billion annually through 2055, including US$46 billion in reduced fuel costs, and US$16 billion in reduced maintenance and repair costs for drivers.


The coal industry celebrated the announcement on Feb 12 saying it would help stave off retirements of aging coal-fired power plants.

“Utilities have announced plans to retire more than 55,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation over the next five years.  Reversing these retirement decisions could help offset the need to build new, more expensive electricity sources and prevent the loss of reliability attributes, such as fuel security, that the coal fleet provides,” said America’s Power President and CEO Michelle Bloodworth.

While many industry groups back the repeal of stringent vehicle emission standards, others have been reluctant to show public support for rescinding the endangerment finding because of the legal and regulatory uncertainty it could unleash.

Legal experts said the policy reversal could, for example, lead to a surge in lawsuits known as "public nuisance" actions, a pathway that had been blocked following a 2011 Supreme Court ruling that GHG regulation should be left in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency instead of the courts.

"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it," said Mr Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor.

Environmental groups have slammed the proposed repeal as a danger to the climate. Future US administrations seeking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions likely would need to reinstate the endangerment finding, a task that could be politically and legally complex.

"There'll be a lawsuit brought almost immediately, and we'll see in them in court. And we will win," said Mr David Doniger, senior attorney at the NRDC. REUTERS

But environmental groups are confident that the courts will continue their track record of backing the EPA's authority to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases.

Several environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, have said they will challenge the reversal in court, setting off what could be a years-long legal battle up to the Supreme Court.

Text: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday repealed the endangerment finding ruling, calling it the “largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States,” which will save Americans billions of dollars in hidden taxes every year.

Zeldin formally rescinded what is known as the “endangerment finding,” which provided the legal basis for the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane.

The EPA chief has called it the “largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States.”

During a Breitbart Fight Club Roundtable last July, the administrator explained why it was necessary to repeal the finding. He said that the finding has led to more than one trillion dollars in regulatory impact.

He said that the Endangerment Finding never made a “straight-line conclusion” that carbon dioxide from motor vehicle engines causes “endangerment.” He called the Endangerment Finding the “holy grail of the climate change religion.” It created the legal basis for the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, in the belief that the emissions are an alleged threat to public health and welfare.

He said in a written statement last July:

With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers. In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year. We heard loud and clear the concern that EPA’s GHG emissions standards themselves, not carbon dioxide which the Finding never assessed independently, was the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods. If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families. [Emphasis added]

WATCH — New Car Savings and More with Repeal of Obama-Era Greenhouse Gas Rule:

Steve Milloy, former Trump EPA Transition Team Advisor and Senior Fellow at the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, said in written statement:

Rescinding the endangerment finding is great but it’s not the ballgame. Not only does the rescission have to stand up in court, it must result in the overturning of the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, where the Court wrongly ruled that EPA could regulate greenhouse gases even though Congress did not expressly authorize it. The 2022 SCOTUS decision in West Virginia v. EPA held that EPA must have express congressional authorization for major regulatory programs. So endangerment finding litigation must result in West Virginia v. EPA trumping Massachusetts v. EPA.

He added, “Even if the Trump EPA wins in court with respect to rescinding the endangerment finding, without also overturning Massachusetts v. EPA, the next Democrat-run EPA will simply re-issue the endangerment finding and all the Trump EPA’s great work will have been erased.”

Text: US President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.

The so-called 2009 "endangerment finding" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.

The White House called the reversal the "largest deregulation in American history", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.

Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was "a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers".

"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history," added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.

Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.

"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money," he wrote on X.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.

The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.

With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.

"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases," said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.

"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing."

Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.

Reversing the finding would reduce automobile manufacturers' spending by $2,400 per vehicle, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team.

"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles," said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.

"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks," he said.

For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.

"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards," said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.

"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars."

While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.

While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.

The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed "nuisance" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.

"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ," said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.

"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are."

One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based.

The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.

That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.

But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.

While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.

In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.

Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.

"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis," said Meghan Greenfield.

"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation."

Text: Oklahoma is set to execute a man convicted of killing two men in a drive-by shooting in 2006

McALESTER, Okla. -- A man who apologized for killing two men in a drive-by shooting after a nightclub altercation was set to be put to death Thursday in the first execution of the year in Oklahoma and the second in the United States.

Kendrick Simpson, 45, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary for his convictions in the 2006 killings of 19-year-old Anthony Jones and 20-year-old Glen Palmer, who were fatally shot after a dispute at an Oklahoma City club.

Simpson, who had fled to Oklahoma City from the devastated city of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, admitted to the killings during a clemency hearing last month. He apologized to the victims’ families and to a third man who was in the vehicle when Jones and Palmer were shot.

“I apologize for murdering your sons,” Simpson said at the hearing. “I don't make any excuses. I don't blame others, and they didn't deserve what happened to them.”

Despite his apology, the state’s five-member Pardon and Parole Board narrowly voted to deny Simpson clemency.

And on Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Supreme Court had no comment as it rejected a late appeal to block the execution.

Simpson’s attorneys had argued that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from chronic trauma in his childhood years growing up in a New Orleans housing project.

“Kendrick is a man worthy of your mercy and compassion,” his attorneys wrote in his clemency application. “The death penalty is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst offenses and offenders. Kendrick and his case represent neither.”

On the night of the killing in January 2006, prosecutors say, Simpson had placed an assault rifle in the trunk of a vehicle that he and his friends drove to a club in northwest Oklahoma City. After an altercation at the club between Simpson and Palmer, prosecutors say Simpson and his friends followed Palmer and Jones from a nearby gas station and that Simpson pointed the gun out the window and fired about 20 rounds into their car. Both victims were shot multiple times.

Some of the victims' family members told the board they supported his execution.

“Do I believe this man should live and be able to breathe and take out the rest of his life behind a cell?” Palmer's sister, Crystal Allison, wrote in a letter to the panel. “He made the choice for him so I stand here today to make the choice for my family. Yes, we would like to see him executed for what he did — he executed my brother.”

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond commended the board for denying Simpson clemency, calling him a “ruthless and violent killer who hunted his victims without remorse.”

The state uses the sedative midazolam, followed by vecuronium bromide to halt the breathing and potassium chloride to stop the heart.

Simpson's scheduled execution was to be the second of the year in the United States. Florida, which conducted a state record of 19 executions in 2025, put Ronald Palmer Heath to death with a three-drug injection on Tuesday for his conviction in the 1989 killing of a traveling salesman he and his brother met at a Gainesville bar.

A total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025 with Florida leading the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second place with five executions each that year.

Florida is scheduled to carry out the next execution in the U.S. on Tuesday, the planned lethal injection of Melvin Trotter for the killing of a grocery store owner during a robbery.

The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the most aggressive move by the Republican president to roll back climate regulations.

The rule finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding by the Obama administration is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

President Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far” while EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the endangerment finding “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach.”

Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,” adding that it “had no basis in fact” or law. “On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony.

Legal challenges are certain for an action that repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks, and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions by the Trump administration to roll back dozens of environmental rules, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the UCLA School of Law.

Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.

The EPA also said it will propose a two-year delay to a Biden-era rule restricting greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks. And the agency will end tax credits for automakers who install automatic start-stop ignition systems in their vehicles. The device is intended to reduce emissions, but Zeldin said “everyone hates” it.

Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying that in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country.”

The endangerment finding “led to trillions of dollars in regulations that strangled entire sectors of the United States economy, including the American auto industry,” Zeldin said. “The Obama and Biden administrations used it to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish list of costly climate policies, electric vehicle mandates and other requirements that assaulted consumer choice and affordability.”

The endangerment finding and the regulations based on it “didn’t just regulate emissions, it regulated and targeted the American dream. And now the endangerment finding is hereby eliminated,” Zeldin said.

The Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The endangerment finding is widely considered the legal foundation that underpins a series of regulations intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change. That includes deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as White House climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration's actions reckless. "This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.

EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy said, adding that the health and environmental hazards of climate change have "become impossible to ignore.”

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said Trump's action “prioritizes the profits of big oil and gas companies and polluters over clean air and water” and children's health.

“As a result of this repeal, I’m going to see more sick kids come into the Emergency Department having asthma attacks and more babies born prematurely,” she said in a statement. “My colleagues will see more heart attacks and cancer in their patients.”

David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump and Zeldin are trying to use repeal of the finding as a “kill shot’’ that would allow the administration to make nearly all climate regulations invalid. The repeal could erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to address global warming.

The EPA action follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

Withdrawing the endangerment finding “is the most important step taken by the Trump administration so far to return to energy and economic sanity,” said Myron Ebell, a conservative activist who has questioned the science behind climate change.

Zeldin and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have moved to drastically scale back limits on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Rules imposed under Democratic President Joe Biden were intended to encourage U.S. automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.

The Trump administration announced a proposal in December to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The EPA said its two-year delay to a Biden-era rule on greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks will give the agency time to develop a plan that better reflects the reality of slower EV sales, while promoting consumer choice and lowering prices.

The mileage plan would significantly reduce requirements that set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline. Trump said the rule change will lower the price of new cars and increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Environmental groups said the plan would keep polluting, gas-burning cars and trucks on U.S. roads for years to come, threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.

Not for nothing is that the US is now considered a scientifically rogue nation, powerful people bought themselves a government that will always prioritize billionaire's profits well above the public, the problem is that this affects people all over the world.

This is just the hurricane sharpie humiliation once again, just with enough money behind to ensure nobody will be around Trump to tell him how wrong he is.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as White House climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration's actions reckless. "This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.

Anti-science and pandering to fossil fuel interests.

In science, Trump may be a pioneer in how to treat viruses with household cleaning products, but I’m not sure he knows too much about this field.

The fact and science will stay there despite political winds that only happened once every four years.

Well, our generation may survive, but our descendants are screwed.

Good news.

Good news.

Not for the planet...

Good news.

What do you have against public health?

People will die needlessly because of this.

Trump's EPA revokes scientific finding that underpinned U.S. fight against climate change

Just because he is a very stable genius?

Good news.

A 79 years old going against sciences is "Good news"? How?

Expect ocean temperatures to rise, resulting in more sea life to be affected, and thus smaller hauls of seafood.

Expect more severe weather; longer and more brutal summers. Here in Japan, I remember when I first came here in the late 90's it would snow heavily in Tokyo in December. Now, I never see it snow in the Tokyo area in December.  Last year, I only had to use my snow shovel once.

The severe weather has also affected food crops and thus a rise in food prices.  Expect more of that to happen.  Not looking forward to that.

Trump's EPA revokes scientific finding that underpinned U.S. fight against climate change

And why?  Simple - Corruption 101...

The big oil, gas, and coal company CEOs all made multi-million dollar contributions to his campaign - this is the payoff...

it's just the typical way of doing business in decadent, depraved, disgusting MAGA-world...

Anti-science and pandering to fossil fuel interests.

Yes = billionaires. Prioritize the rich over the environment.

Great that CO2 no longer has any ill-effect on public health: pump the oval offuce full of it

US farmers and ranchers suffer from climate change.

US farmers and ranchers are facing severe financial and operational disruptions due to climate change, with damages from extreme weather, including droughts, floods, and wildfires, causing billions in losses annually, such as over

$20 billion in 2024 alone. These impacts, which include reduced crop yields, higher livestock mortality, and shifting, unpredictable growing seasons, threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the broader food supply.

Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change.

considering all that blatant hyperbole, this is likely the correct choice.

Sounds like what someone would say when getting their funding eliminated, follow the money.

Of course, there is the ton of scientific evidence.  But you don't even need that.  Just see how the weather has changed in Japan itself.  Longer summers, stronger storms, resulting in smaller crop yields.  Also, the hauls for fish has been getting smaller and smaller, due to slight rises in ocean temperatures and pollution.  All around the world, there has been reports of severe storms, tornadoes in places that had never experienced one, constant flooding, etc.

Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,” adding that it “had no basis in fact” or law. “On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony.

Who profited if it's a scam?

considering all that blatant hyperbole, this is likely the correct choice.

Exactly.

Trump claims to know more about science than anyone.

Trump has frequently claimed to possess, or have a "natural instinct" for, expertise inVarious scientific and technical areas, often contradicting established expert consensus. These assertions have spanned across climate science, epidemiology, and specialized technology, with Trump often stating he understands these topics better than scientists and officials.

Intellectual curiosity and thirst for knowledge is obviously the weakest point of MAGA, who’s narrative and floating lies depend on ignorance.

MAGA is the kid at school who doesn’t value education and denies science because he/she cannot comprehend things they can’t see.

Molecular level biology and chemistry is a myth to them, so they just skip it, and deny existence of why life occurs, as science means nothing to the feeble minded.

What is their daily lives is the worst of not only humanity, but for the earth, and certainly the selfish nature of man at its worst in the form of MAGA is destroying the planet at its quickest rate, ever.

Then have Congress vote on it and try and pass legislation then, but Obama implemented this and if he wants to scrap this deal, he can do that. Personally, I’m glad he did it, you do not oppose and hinder or block the free market.

Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,”

Well, if it is a "scam", then it would involve pretty much every sane and intelligent person on the face of this planet because pretty much every nation is in agreement with this issue.   I think the fossil fuel grift is a much more dangerous scam.

"" The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the most aggressive move by the Republican president to roll back climate regulations. ""

They say IGNORCE is DEADLY and her is a classic example.

Mr. Trump sighted that automobile prices will get cheaper due to this move, this is a proof that Mr. Trump has NO CLUE of what greenhouse gas emissions even means.

considering all that blatant hyperbole, this is likely the correct choice.

What hyperbole are you talking about? the description you quote is perfectly correct.

you do not oppose and hinder or block the free market.

Are there any environmental regulations you approve of?

considering all that blatant hyperbole, this is likely the correct choice.

= "I don't like the other 'team'."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established on December 2, 1970, by President Richard Nixon to consolidate federal environmental responsibilities. Following public outcry and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, Nixon signed an executive order, approved by Congress, to create the agency.

Then have Congress vote on it and try and pass legislation then, but Obama implemented this and if he wants to scrap this deal, he can do that. Personally, I’m glad he did it, you do not oppose and hinder or block the free market.

Trump the destroyer.

“The Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.”

Just wait til it gets to the…oh.

Well, if it is a "scam", then it would involve pretty much every sane and intelligent person on the face of this planet because pretty much every nation is in agreement with this issue.

I just care what happens in the U.S.

I think the fossil fuel grift is a much more dangerous scam.

I don't, now if you can find another material that can make everything go for it.

Trump gunning for the Nobel for the sciences this time

Not for the planet..

Really, well there is no life on the planet without CO2, so good news for the planet..

I just care what happens in the U.S

Thinking that what happens in other parts of the world will not come back to affect what happens to where you live is quite naive.  In today's world, no nation is an island.

None of the measures are about eliminating CO2 completely, so it is still horrible news for the planet, and for the US that by geography is bound to be affected importantly.

Trump has a very limited amount of days left on this planet, and combine that with his narcissism, it makes sense he has no care for the future.

Trump's EPA revokes scientific finding

The lunatic fight of Don Quixote and his minions against reality continues.

Posters who support Trump's position on this issue don't seem to realize that this is not a Republican political stance they're supporting; they are in full accord with the rape-murder of the planet and its inhabitants. They should be ashamed of themselves.

Another step in the mindless “big leap backward” with serious short term and long term consequences for the entire universe.

The head in the sand mentality is a dangerous embarrassment.

The Emperor has declared that global warming is not really happening. This is on a par with him taking a sharpie and declaring "this is where the hurricane will go." Wow. Unbelievable, but it is really happening to us. How many more people will die because of this clown?

Everyone and or everybody deserves clean air and clean water regardless of political affiliation or lack of, and if a city or region have attained both over the board environmental regulations are unnecessary.

Trump Suffers Humiliating Blow as Voters Declare Him Worse Than Biden

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-suffers-humiliating-blow-voters-151626914.html

Keep making those bad decisions to distract from the Epstein files!

There are so many examples of the bad consequences of extremely rapid global warming that one could fill up  a tome about the subject.

Here in California one example that I have witnessed is what is happening to our iconic Joshua trees, in the Mojave Desert. The desert is getting too hot and dry for them to survive. The water that they have stored up inside of them is literally cooking them from the inside out. It is sad to witness. Scientific estimates (something that The Orange One ignores) are that they will disappear from 80% of their range by the end of this century. If the climate changed slowly, they could move northward, but with the climate changing so rapidly, it may take human assisted migration to preserve them.

Anyone who has enjoyed seeing the Joshua Trees of California can imagine how seeing them disappear feels. It is like seeing the Redwoods and the Giant Sequoias disappear.

This is not to belittle the dire consequences of rapid global warming on humans.

Forgot to add to my comment....these giant fossil fuel companies are not singularly owned by some individual.

They are shareholder companies.

Large groups of investors/shareholders will leave companies that deny climate science......so I cant see this Trump announcement being of any more worth than "Mexico will pay for the wall "

Global warming can also cause higher levels of erosion, desertification, and the bleaching of coral reefs.  All things that will eventually trickle down to us.

Forgot to add to my comment....these giant fossil fuel companies are not singularly owned by some individual.

For Trump, things go better with (privately owned) Koch.

What an moron.

Just a moron.

This will be another part of his gombeen legacy

Climate changes have been going on for many centuries, nothing new.

Many civilizations have perished as nothing was done about it.

1/ America is not the world.

No, but our dollar and military are.

2/Fossil fuel companies have accepted the science of climate change.

Yes, and fossil fuels will continue for

3/Most of the giants in this area have policies and actions to reduce CO2 and other gases

And we have done so, an remain doing so.

4/Most of the above mega companies have statements of intent you can see on the company's sites on the net.

Depends

5/ For the USA, under Trump....more isolation, more ridicule.

That's fine.

Trump and the MAGA clowns know absolutely nothing about science. That scares them, therefore they declare themselves to be above science. And just like that the US becomes the most pathetic miserable, wretched country on earth.

Climate changes have been going on for many centuries, nothing new.

Correct.

The ‘Fox News Sunday’ panel weighs in on the debate over abortion pills and the potential influence of pro-life activists on the Trump administration.

Puerto Rico's Republican governor on Thursday signed a bill that amends a law to recognize an unborn baby as a human being, which opponents argued could eventually lead to outlawing abortion in the U.S. territory.

Gov. Jenniffer González said in a statement that the measure "aims to maintain consistency between civil and criminal provisions by recognizing the unborn child as a human being."

The amendment, in Senate Bill 923, altered an article within Puerto Rico's Penal Code that defines murder.

The government said that the amendment complements a law affirming that it would be first-degree murder if a suspect intentionally and knowingly kills a pregnant woman, resulting in the death of the conceived child at any stage of gestation.

The legislation was named after Keishla Rodríguez, a pregnant woman who was killed in April 2021. Her partner, former Puerto Rican boxer Félix Verdejo, was convicted in the killing and received two life sentences.

Supporters of the law said it was designed to provide consistency between civil and criminal codes and focus on harsher punishments for the murder of pregnant women and that it was unrelated to abortion, but critics argued that it opens the door to eventually criminalizing the procedure in Puerto Rico, which remains legal.

"A zygote was given legal personality," Rosa Seguí Cordero, an attorney and spokesperson for the National Campaign for Free, Safe and Accessible Abortion in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. "We women were stripped of our rights."

Dr. Carlos Díaz Vélez, president of Puerto Rico's College of Medical Surgeons, contends that the new law would lead to "defensive health care," in which doctors may refuse to treat complicated pregnancies for fear of criminal prosecution on murder charges.

"This will bring complex clinical decisions into the realm of criminal law," he told The Associated Press, adding that it would bring "disastrous consequences."

Díaz said the amended law also allows a third person to intervene between a doctor and a pregnant woman, which violates privacy laws. He also said new protocols and regulations would need to be implemented.

"The system is not prepared for this," he said.

Opponents of the law also said the amendment was approved without public hearings.

"There is no doubt that the measure did not undergo adequate analysis before its approval and leaves an unacceptable space for ambiguity regarding civil rights," Annette Martínez Orabona, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. "The legislative leadership failed to fulfill its responsibility to the people, and so did the governor."

A federal judge agreed Thursday to block the Pentagon from punishing Democratic Sen Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that Pentagon officials not only violated Kelly's First Amendment free speech rights, but they also “threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.” The judge invoked an old-fashioned rebuke -- “Horsefeathers!” -- in response to the government’s claim that Kelly is trying to exempt himself from the rules of military justice.

“To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!” wrote Leon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.

Kelly, who represents Arizona, sued in federal court to block his Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Leon's order prohibits the Pentagon from implementing or enforcing Kelly's punishment while his lawsuit is pending. The judge instructed the parties to provide him with an update in 30 days.

In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration. Republican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.

The court case is just one front in a broader dispute that has spiraled between the group of Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration since they posted the video. Earlier this week, a Washington grand jury declined to indict the lawmakers over the video.

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin has said she has been told the Justice Department could seek a new indictment as soon as Friday. Kelly and Slotkin said at a news conference Wednesday that they are keeping all legal options on the table regarding potentially suing the administration.

Hegseth said the government will appeal Leon's decision. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain,’” he posted on his X account, referring to Kelly by his rank at retirement.

Leon said that Kelly “is likely to succeed on the merits” of his free speech claim. “He has also shown irreparable harm, and the balance of the equities fall decidedly in his favor.”

Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.

The judge concluded that Kelly's speech is entitled to full First Amendment protection.

“Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired service members, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired service members have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years,” Leon wrote.

“If so,” he added, “they will more fully appreciate why the Founding Fathers made free speech the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights!”

Kelly said in a video statement posted after the ruling that the case was about more than just him and that the administration “was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out.”

He added that the ruling was unlikely the end: “This might not be over yet, because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”

The 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence agencies.

The Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment. Hegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.

Kelly’s lawyers said the Pentagon’s censure of Kelly — and its efforts to reduce his retirement grade and pay — are an unprecedented attack on the rights of veterans to publicly debate national security issues.

“Defendants assert an absolute and unreviewable authority to impose military punishment on a retired veteran and sitting United States Senator for engaging in speech a civilian political appointee dislikes. That position is as alarming as it is unprecedented,” they wrote.

Government lawyers said the case “is not about legislative independence or freedom of speech in civilian society.”

“Instead, this case involves a retired military officer who seeks to use his military status as a sword and his legislative position as a shield against the consequences of his actions in military personnel matters,” they wrote.

Hegseth, the Defense Department, Navy Secretary John Phelan and the Navy are named as defendants in the lawsuit.






A federal judge agreed Thursday to block the Pentagon from punishing Democratic Sen Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.

Senator Kelly, a true patriot, proclaiming a patriotic message, that you have a duty to disobey unlawful orders.

Sure glad we aren't doing lawfare anymore (eyeroll)

The injunction is temporary; it lasts while the court decides the full case.

Now, if the judge ultimately rules against Kelly on the merits, or if an appellate court overturns this injunction, the Pentagon might be able to resume efforts to downgrade his rank/pension under military law. That could include administrative actions that affect his retirement benefits.

The administration could also appeal the judge’s decision now, and higher courts might side with the Pentagon, not sure, but the appeals are on the way.

Now, if the judge ultimately rules against Kelly on the merits, or if an appellate court overturns this injunction, the Pentagon might be able to resume efforts to downgrade his rank/pension under military law.

Yeah, that's not going to happen. Kelly is retired.

I thought that the right celebrates veterans and war heroes.

This judge has zero “standing” or any authority at all over this matter.

So much law-fare that federal civilian judges  now supposedly can block any military punishments for their favored politicians.

even in advance of any final decision to punish or before what the punishment might be is even made.

Yeah, that's not going to happen. Kelly is retired.

Yes, it will happen, because he's still part of the military branch and receives his benefits from them and in America, we do have an appeals process, so I have no idea what you're talking about

I thought that the right celebrates veterans and war heroes.

Yes, but not when they push for an insubordinate sedition


This judge has zero “standing” or any authority at all over this matter.

To which the judge countered:

“This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” he wrote. “After all, as Bob Dylan famously said, ‘You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.’ To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!”

I like this judge - he has good taste in music.


So much law-fare that federal civilian judges now supposedly can block any military punishments for their favored politicians.

It's not lawfare.

even in advance of any final decision to punish or before what the punishment might be is even made.

Yup. Good, isn't it. Protecting Constitutional rights pre-emptively.

bass4funk

Yes, it will happen, because he's still part of the military branch and receives his benefits from them

There has never been a case where benefits and/or ranks has been changed after someone has retired.

and in America, we do have an appeals process, so I have no idea what you're talking about

I know you have the appeals process, but it won't result in Kelly being demoted nad/or benefits reduced.

I thought that the right celebrates veterans and war heroes.

Yes, but not when they push for an insubordinate sedition

Well, that's obviously not the case here.

There has never been a case where benefits and/or ranks has been changed after someone has retired.

Until now.

I know you have the appeals process, but it won't result in Kelly being demoted nad/or benefits reduced.

Well, that's obviously not the case here.

That's your opinion, I have a different one.

Bob Dylan is quite irrelevant here.notivd he didn’t quote any constitutional law here.

so now every order a military member is given can be reviewed by a federal civilian judge for constitutionality?

no, this is dumb.

bass4funk

There has never been a case where benefits and/or ranks has been changed after someone has retired.

Until now.

Nah, won't happen. You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

I kind'a wish the trial had happened - just to get Drunken Pete on the witness stand and ask him to read this paragraph from the UCMJ and MCM;

"The Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) dictate that service members are only required to obey lawful orders and have a duty to disobey orders that are "patently illegal".  If an order is clearly unlawful, military law mandates refusal."

And no doubt it would fail and just give Kelly more energy going into 2028 - a typical Trump self-own...


There has never been a case where benefits and/or ranks has been changed after someone has retired.

say WHAT?

you might want to sit this one out. Unless you are intentionally misinforming people.

Judge Leon’s ruling followed a hearing last week in which he told lawyers for the Defense Department that they were asking him to create a new precedent and extend the free speech restrictions commonly applied to active-duty service members to a retired officer.

“You’re asking me to do something that the Supreme Court has never done,” the judge said in the hearing.

and have a duty to disobey orders that are "patently illegal". If an order is clearly unlawful, military law mandates refusal."

so Mark Kelly, a partisan politician and a retiree, now decides what is “patently illegal”?

then anyone who disobeys an order the military claims IS lawful just goes to federal court to get military punishment reversed?

nonsensical, then why have a military court system or military justice or military rules, order or discipline?


and have a duty to disobey orders that are "patently illegal". If an order is clearly unlawful, military law mandates refusal."

so Mark Kelly, a partisan politician and a retiree, now decides what is “patently illegal”?

No.

that the Supreme Court has never done

oh the Supreme Court has never done it (yet).

But military courts have this authority.

yet this judge under his civilian authority? (and Bon Dylan’s? ) is now saying he can order the military not to do.

So quite different than your claim.

Thank goodness the courts are still working and did the right thing!

Mark Kelly, a partisan politician and a retiree, now decides what is “patently illegal”?

then anyone who disobeys an order the military claims IS lawful just goes to federal court to get military punishment reversed?

nonsensical, then why have a military court system or military justice or military rules, order or discipline?

Well, of course, an appeals process will take place, it doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks, that is our system and the DOD has the right to take whatever action it deemed necessary.

that is our system and the DOD has the right to take whatever action it deemed necessary.

DOD, that’s right.

Hegseth wouldn’t like it, well done.

DOD, that’s right.

Hegseth wouldn’t like it, well done.

I disagree

*and *have a duty to disobey orders that are "patently illegal". If an order is clearly unlawful, military law mandates refusal."

so Mark Kelly, a partisan politician and a retiree, now decides what is “patently illegal”?

Stop gaslighting - he said what is written in the MCM - you have a duty to NOT follow illegal orders...

then anyone who disobeys an order the military claims IS lawful just goes to federal court to get military punishment reversed?

nonsensical, then why have a military court system or military justice or military rules, order or discipline?

More gaslighting...every post is both nonsensical and inaccurate...

Ok. So Who decides an order is illegal?

we know what orders Mark Kelly wants to claim are illegal.

which orders are actually illegal, who decides it, and how?

DOD, that’s right.

Hegseth wouldn’t like it, well done.

I disagree

But you made such a fuss about the name change. Good to see you using the correct name for the Department of Defense.

Text: The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare.

It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.

"This is about as big as it gets,"  President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. "Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding."

Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. "No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles," he said.

The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health.

Zeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history.

Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. "less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money."

The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized "climate denialism as official government policy."

It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA.

Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the Justice Department filing an official misconduct complaint against federal Judge James Boasberg on 'America's Newsroom.'

Alleged members of "foreign terrorist cartel" Tren de Aragua may be brought back to the U.S. after their deportations in 2025, and it could come at taxpayers' expense.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who has repeatedly butted heads with the Trump administration, ordered the Trump administration Thursday to facilitate the return of 137 migrants deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, CECOT, in 2025.

Boasberg stipulated in his ruling that the government pay for the migrants' airfare back to the U.S., meaning taxpayers are likely footing the bill.

Boasberg argued that it's "unclear why Plaintiffs should bear the financial cost of their return in such an instance," noting that "this situation would never have arisen had the Government simply afforded Plaintiffs their constitutional rights before initially deporting them."

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS DEPORTED VENEZUELANS TO BE RETURNED TO US


The ruling comes as part of a nearly year-long saga during which the federal judge attempted to halt the Trump administration's deportation of migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act in March 2025.

The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the Trump administration to continue using the Alien Enemies Act to carry out deportations in April but ordered that detainees receive notice and an opportunity to challenge allegations.

Boasberg has since been wading through legal avenues with the men in El Salvador, issuing a ruling in December that the Trump administration denied them due process.

It is unclear how many of the men will actually take the offer and return to the U.S., with Boasberg noting that the noncitizens "would be detained upon arrival" back to the U.S.

Similar to Boasberg's ruling, another federal judge this month ordered the Trump administration to pay for the return of three migrant families the judge ruled ICE unlawfully deported by a 2023 humanitarian parole settlement.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital Thursday in response to the ruling that the illegal aliens in El Salvador were removed under proper legal authority, before taking a shot as Boasberg.

"Nothing has changed; in addition to being in our country illegally, these aliens are foreign terrorists designated as alien enemies by the president," McLaughlin told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP ADMIN SAYS MADURO CAPTURE REINFORCES ALIEN ENEMIES ACT REMOVALS

"They were removed under the proper legal authorities. This case is no longer about the facts or law but about Judge Boasberg’s crusade to stop President Trump from doing the will of the American People. He has been shut down by appellate courts again and again on this case."

Boasberg has become a prime target for Republicans over a string of rulings tied to Trump-era policies, including the Trump administration backing a potential judicial impeachment of the judge and other "rogue" judges in January.

The migrants in El Salvador were removed under The Alien Enemies Act, which is a 1798 wartime immigration law the Trump administration invoked to deport violent gang members with alleged ties to criminal organizations, such as Tren de Aragua (TdA).

TdA, as well as MS-13, were designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration's State Department in February 2025.

The administration has described those deported to the notoriously secure prison in El Salvador as "violent savages" and terrorists who pose a threat to U.S. security.

A previous analysis of 238 migrants deported to El Salvador found six faced attempted murder, assault, armed robbery, gun possession or domestic battery charges in the U.S., the Texas Tribune reported in May 2025.

Thirty-two other deportees had been convicted in the U.S. of crimes, many of which were nonviolent, according to the outlet.


DHS has said deportees labeled "‘non-criminals" by the media are "terrorists, human rights abusers, gang members and more — they just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S."

Archbishop Andrew Thazhath of Kerala has drawn criticism from lay groups in Kerala for claiming in an interview last week that a banned Islamist group was posing a threat to the Christian community by promoting sectarianism.

Thazhath, the outgoing president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, told the church-run Deepika newspaper that the Popular Front of India had “planned to break up” the Catholic' church’s Syro-Malabar section.

His remarks have drawn the ire of lay groups, which maintain that it is Hindutva that poses the main threat not just to Christians but also to India’s multireligious character.

Almaaya Munnettam , Catholic group in Kerala, has demanded evidence for Thazhath’s claims, warning that such contentions would foster communal discord ahead of the Kerala assembly elections expected to he held in April.

The archbishop’s statements echo a pattern where sections of the church have adopted narratives aligned with the rhetoric of the Bharatiya Janata Party, framing Muslims as threats.

From a national perspective, Muslims and Christians face parallel persecution from Hindutva groups. There are almost no documented cases of organised Muslim violence against Christians.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom confirms this.

In its 2025 annual report, the commission documented persistent attacks on minorities in India: over 98% of the 1,165 recorded incidents in early 2024 targeted Muslims. Christians, comprising 2.3% of the population, accounted for about 10% of cases.

Last year, 1,318 hate speech events were recorded by India Hate Lab, up 13% from 2024. Muslims were the primary target.

Still, anti-Christian incidents were up 41% from 115 in 2024 to 162 in 2025. In the decade from 2014, there was a 500% increase in reported violence against Christians, rising from 139 in 2014 to 834 in 2024. Most occurred in states ruled by the BJP.

National Crimes Record Bureau data and independent trackers show that communal violence disproportionately affects Muslims through cow vigilantism, demolitions and anti-conversion laws.

Christians are targeted via accusations of forced conversions. In 2024 and 2025, there were more than 700 attacks on Christians each year.

The US religious freedom panels February 2026 update highlighted escalating mob attacks on Christians in January alone, including the assault of a pastor in Odisha who was forced to eat cow dung. In July 2025, Hindu mobs attacked clergy in several states.

Despite Thazhath’s anxieties, statements of the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India have repeatedly condemn these Hindutva attacks, urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to denounce violence and uphold constitutional values.

For instance, in July 2025, the bishops expressed alarm over the remarks of the BJP’s Gopichand Padalkar, an MLA from Maharashtra, offering rewards to those who attacked Christian priests.

Muslim violence against Christians remains negligible. Isolated incidents have been reported in Jammu and Kashmir but no national pattern exists comparable to Hindutva-led assaults.

However, this writer has documented church leaders who have echoed Hindutva language on matters such as “love jihad”. Love jihad is a conspiracy theory claiming that Muslim men court women of other faiths merely to force them to convert to Islam. This sort of rhetoric causes the church to lose secular and Muslim partners while gaining none from Hindutva supporters.

Both Muslims and Christians suffer economic and social marginalisation. Prison Statistics India 2023 shows that Muslims constitute 16.5% of inmates despite being 14.2% of the country’s total population. Dalits, who form 16.6% of India’s population, constitute 22% of prisoners. Thirteen per cent of prisoners are Adivasi though they are only 8.6% of the national population. In some states, Christians appear overrepresented in undertrials.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey 2023-’24 records Muslim unemployment at 3.2% (up from 2.4% the previous year) and Christians at 4.7% (up from 4.5%). The national rate was 3.2.

Supreme Court petitions by Christian groups have been seeking minority status extensions for Dalit Christians, denied since 1950 despite Sikh and Buddhist Dalits receiving Scheduled Caste benefits in 1956 and 1990.

The All India Catholic Union statements echo these demands for equity, linking internal caste bias to broader external exclusion.

Hindutva policies such as the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens, cow slaughter bans and Uniform Civil Code pushes in Uttarakhand target Muslims first but ensnare Christians via anti-conversion laws in 12 states.

Uttar Pradesh’s 2025 bill proposes life imprisonment for conversions. While bulldozer demolitions hit Muslim homes, church attacks follow conversion accusations. The Manipur 2023 violence, though ethnic, displaced 60,000 mostly Christian Kukis amid Meitei Hindu dominance. No equivalent Muslim-led campaigns exist against Christians.

Press releases of the Catholic bishops have repeatedly call for unity. In February, the bishops urged condemnation of attacks. The All India Catholic Union has criticised the BJP’s Kerala outreach exploiting Islamophobia.

There have been rare inter-minority tensions, but data shows these to be insignificant compared to Hindutva violence. Economic anxieties fuel some Christian fears of Muslim demographic growth, yet census data shows that India’s Muslim population, which stands at 14.2% of the total population, has grown only modestly since Independence. Global factors like Christian Zionism play a minor role in driving Christian fears about Muslims in India, but Hindutva is the primary threat.

Thazhath’s claims about a Muslim threat to Indian Christians are an attempt to distract from the real problem.

The ⁠administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the repeal of a scientific finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, and eliminated federal tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks.

It is the most sweeping climate change policy rollback by the administration to date, after a string of regulatory cuts and other moves intended to unfetter fossil fuel development and stymie the rollout of clean energy.

"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding, a disastrous Obama-era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and drove up prices for American consumers," Trump said, saying it was the biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.

The Environmental Protection Agency said in a press release the ​endangerment finding had relied on an incorrect interpretation of federal clean air laws meant to protect Americans from pollutants that do harm through local or regional exposure, not through warming the global climate.

"This flawed legal theory ‌took the ‌agency outside the scope of its statutory authority in multiple respects," it said. Trump announced the repeal beside EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House budget director Russ Vought, ​who has long sought to revoke the finding and was a key architect of conservative policy blueprint Project 2025.

Trump has said he believes climate change is a "con job," and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement, leaving the world’s largest historic contributor to global warming out of international efforts to combat it. He has also signed legislation killing Biden-era tax credits aimed at accelerating deployment of electric cars and renewable energy.

Former U.S. President ⁠Barack Obama blasted the move on X, saying without the endangerment finding, "we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money."

Zeldin said the Trump administration took ⁠on the most consequential climate policy of the last 15 years, something that the agency avoided during his first term amid industry concern about legal and regulatory uncertainty.

"Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated," he said.

The endangerment finding was first adopted by the United States in 2009, and led the EPA ​to take action under the Clean Air Act of 1963 to curb emissions ⁠of carbon dioxide, methane, and four other heat-trapping air pollutants from vehicles, power plants and other industries.

It came about after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 in the Massachusetts vs. EPA case that the agency has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Its repeal would remove the ⁠regulatory requirements to measure, report, certify, and comply ​with federal greenhouse gas emission standards for cars, but may not initially apply to stationary sources such as power plants.

The transportation and power sectors ​are each responsible for around a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas output, according to EPA figures.

The EPA said the repeal and end of vehicle emission standards will save U.S. taxpayers $1.3 trillion, ​while the prior administration said ‌the rules would have net benefits to consumers through lower fuel costs and other savings.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing major automakers, did not endorse the action but said "automotive emissions regulations finalized in the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace demand for EVs."

The Environmental Defense Fund said that the repeal will end up costing Americans more, despite EPA's statement that climate regulations have driven up costs for consumers.

"Administrator Lee Zeldin has directed EPA to stop protecting the American people from the pollution that's causing worse storms, floods, and skyrocketing insurance costs," said EDF President Fred Krupp. "This ‌action will only lead to more of this pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families."

Under former U.S. President Joe Biden, the EPA aimed to cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50% by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels and forecast between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric.

The agency then estimated that the rules would result in net benefits of $99 billion annually through 2055, including $46 billion in reduced fuel costs, and $16 billion in reduced maintenance and repair costs for drivers.


The coal industry celebrated the announcement on ​Thursday saying ​it would help stave off retirements of aging coal-fired power plants.

"Utilities have announced plans to retire more than 55,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation over the next five ​years. Reversing these retirement decisions could help offset the need to build new, more expensive electricity sources and prevent the loss of reliability attributes, such as fuel security, that the coal fleet provides,” said America’s Power President and CEO Michelle Bloodworth.

While many ⁠industry groups back the repeal of stringent vehicle emission standards, others have been reluctant to show public support for rescinding the endangerment finding because of the legal and regulatory uncertainty it could unleash. Legal experts said the policy reversal could, for example, lead to a surge in lawsuits known as "public nuisance" actions, a pathway that had been blocked following a 2011 Supreme Court ruling that GHG regulation should be left in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency instead of the courts.

"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it," said Robert Percival, a University of ​Maryland environmental law professor.

Environmental groups have slammed the proposed repeal as a danger to the climate. Future U.S. administrations seeking to regulate greenhouse gas emissions likely would need to reinstate the endangerment finding, a task that could be politically and legally complex.

But environmental groups are confident that the courts will continue their track record of backing the EPA's authority to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases.

Several environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, have said they will challenge the reversal in court, setting off what could be a years-long legal battle up to the Supreme Court.

"There'll be a lawsuit brought almost immediately, and we'll see in them in court. And we will win," said David Doniger, senior attorney at the NRDC.

Text: As BJP MP Nishikant Dubey gave notice Thursday for a substantive motion against Rahul Gandhi seeking his “immediate expulsion” from Lok Sabha, the Leader of Opposition again targeted the Prime Minister and the government over the trade deal with the US and told them “do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers” and “will not budge even an inch”.

Gandhi’s remarks came a day after he mounted a sharp attack on the government in Lok Sabha, accusing it of compromising India’s energy security and farm interests in the trade deal with the US.

On Thursday, BJP’s Dubey submitted a notice on a substantive motion, seeking Gandhi’s “immediate expulsion” from the Lok Sabha after initiating an “inquiry to examine all his unethical conduct”. He later raised the matter in the House.

The substantive motion is a rarely used tool in the legislative body to ensure a discussion and voting on the motion if it is accepted.

In Lok Sabha, Dubey said, “Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi behaves like an urban Naxal and he has relations with the Soros Foundation and Ford Foundation. He goes on meeting anti-nationals in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bahrain. He raises allegations sometimes against the Election Commission, Constitutional authorities, Speaker and sometimes the Supreme Court. There should be a discussion on the substantive motion, his membership should be cancelled and he should not be allowed to contest election ever… Yeh desh ko tukde tukde karna chahta hai (He wants to break the nation).”

His remarks led to a ruckus with Opposition MPs protesting. Krishna Prasad Tenneti, who was chairing the proceedings, adjourned the House for the day.

In his notice, Dubey said Gandhi, with the help of foreign organisations, has “very cleverly able to capture the most pious dais of Parliament to foment public sentiments, levelling unsubstantiated allegations not only against the Election Commission of India but even our Honourable Supreme Court of India, lowering the dignity of the Government without any substantive evidence and putting various others institutions in bad light”.

He alleged that Gandhi had entered into the “world of unethical conduct” and had become a major constituent of the “Thuggery Gang to destabilise India from within”. He said his “relentless and well-choreographed actions, within and outside Parliament, are inimical to our country, a serious aspect of discussion in the entire nook and corner of the country”.

Dubey also clarified that he had not moved a privilege motion against Gandhi, but given notice for a substantive motion.

Meanwhile, government sources said there has been no decision on moving a privilege motion against Rahul Gandhi, but it will seek the removal from House records of more words and lines from the speech that Gandhi has not authenticated.

Gandhi hit back, saying he will stand firmly with farmers. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “opened doors for foreigners looking to capture our agriculture market for years”.

In a video statement, Gandhi said even if an FIR or case is registered, or a privilege motion brought, he will continue to fight for the farmers.

He accused Modi of being “anti-farmer”, of “selling” the country in the deal with the US, and of being in a “chokehold”.

“The Congress fought for food security and Narendra Modi has betrayed our food security and our farmers. By striking a deal with the US, he has sold cotton, soya, apple and fruit farmers. Since years, foreigners have been trying to capture our agriculture market,” Gandhi said.

“This is the truth, he (Modi) also knows this… Narendra Modi’s reins are in the hands of (US President) Donald Trump,” he said.

Gandhi said Modi had earlier brought the “black farm laws” and had now opened the doors of the agriculture market to foreign powers.

“American farmers have farm lands that are in acres, it is all mechanised and the government gives them subsidy. On the other hand, the farms of our farmers are small, they don’t get MSP and there is no mechanisation,” he said.

“Narendra Modi has sold the country and its farmers. You put cases against me, abuse me. Do whatever you want, file a privilege motion, it does not matter to me, I have spoken the truth in Parliament, you may not like it, that is a different matter, but the country knows the truth. Do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers. I will not budge even an inch,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Gandhi, responding to questions on the substantive motion, said the media was doing “a disservice to the country” by taking a “keyword” from “the government and running shows on that”.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin discusses overseeing California wildfire recovery after being appointed by President Donald Trump for the job on ‘Hannity.’

FIRST ON FOX: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday will eliminate the "2009 Obama EPA Endangerment Finding," which set in motion most federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles, saving Americans billions.

The 2009 development was an EPA finding that carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and three other greenhouse gases "endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations" under the Clean Air Act — leading to a slew of new restrictions and regulations.

An ensuing Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA found greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants and that if the EPA determines they endanger public health or welfare it can regulate them.

"As I traveled across all 50 states this past year, I heard from countless Americans who not only dislike the (motor-vehicle) start-stop feature but passionately advocated for this mechanism to be a thing of the past," Zeldin said of the major recission made Thursday.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)

"Not only do many people find start-stop annoying, but it kills the battery of your car without any significant benefit to the environment. The Trump EPA is proudly fixing this stupid feature at Trump Speed."

Zeldin said automakers shouldn’t be forced to adopt or be rewarded for using technologies that represent a "climate participation trophy" with no meaningful reduction in actual pollution.

The former New York lawmaker said consumer choice is a priority for his agency, and that his office will continue to advocate for "commonsense rules."

ZELDIN OVERHAULS BIDEN-ERA WATER RULE TO END ‘WEAPONIZATION’ THAT LED ‘PUDDLES’ TO TRIGGER PRICY PERMITS

US Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy added in a statement that resetting of mileage standards and removal of auto-starts and other greenhouse-gas-regulation-precipitated regulations are part of President Donald Trump’s vision to lower costs and revitalize manufacturing.

All federal greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines subsequent to the 2009 declaration will be rescinded, a source familiar with the situation said.

When it comes to the start-stop off-cycle technology, a credit for it was created by the EPA in 2012 and quickly infuriated motorists who hear their engine click off then on again at a stoplight or in the teller line at the bank.

TEXAS CHALLENGES NEWSOM’S GAS CAR CRACKDOWN, WARNING CALIFORNIA CAN’T DICTATE US AUTO MARKET

The start-stop became a regulatory loophole allowing automakers to claim greenhouse gas credits without actually delivering empirical emission-reduction or human health benefits.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move to rescind the 2009 finding will "be the largest deregulatory action in American history, and it will save the American people $1.3 trillion in crushing regulations," according to multiple reports.

However, the climate change field appears eager to litigate the new rule, as the nonprofit green-focused law firm Earthjustice signaled as much to PBS.


"The Trump administration is abandoning its core responsibility to keep us safe from extreme weather and accelerating climate change," Earthjustic president Abigail Dillen told the outlet.

"There is no way to reconcile EPA's decision with the law, the science and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year. Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court."

Some states, however, were not supportive of the news including Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis said he "stands by (the) science" of the former EPA guidance.

"Protecting people’s health and making our air cleaner should never be a partisan issue," Polis said in a statement.

"The science is clear that pollution from cars and trucks harms our air quality and puts families — especially kids, seniors, and those with health conditions — at greater risk. Rolling back long-standing protections creates uncertainty for consumers and businesses at a time when we should be investing in cleaner air, innovation, and energy diversity."

"These investments aren’t just the right thing for our climate, it’s good business," the Democrat concluded. "Clear, science-based standards give companies the certainty they need to invest and create jobs. Colorado will continue to stand behind science and protect the health and well-being of Coloradans."

Text: WASHINGTON — President Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin unveiled what they called the biggest red tape removal in US history Thursday, axing a sweeping Obama-era anti-greenhouse gas policy and predicting it could save $1.3 trillion, or about $3,823.50 per US resident.

“Today, the Trump EPA has finalized the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,” Zeldin said alongside Trump in the White House Roosevelt Room.

“Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated.”

The repeal ends a policy allowing the feds to regulate fossil fuels by declaring them dangerous to public health.

The so-called “endangerment finding” allowed the EPA to measure and constrain the output of six greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act — including emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide by vehicles amd power plants.

Trump called the finding “a disastrous Obama-era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers,” predicting they would save “trillions of dollars” as a result of Thursday’s action. A detailed savings breakdown was not released.

The president added that his administration was “terminating all additional green emission standards imposed unnecessarily on vehicle models and engines between 2012 and 2027 and beyond.”

Zeldin said the changes could lower car costs by an average of about $2,400.

A number of major regulations premised on the endangerment finding are now subject to repeal, including the Biden administration’s stringent fuel emissions standards, formalized in March 2024 and designed to ensure more than two-thirds of passenger cars and light trucks sold by 2032 are electric or hybrid vehicles.

Another Biden-era regulation, also announced in March 2024, sought to require that work trucks and tractors reduce carbon dioxide emissions by between 25% and 60%, depending on weight category, by 2032.

A second wave of power plant deregulation actions are expected to follow from the EPA.

“The 2009 endangerment finding is the cornerstone of EPA’s regulation over greenhouse gases, so removing it will have a very significant impact on multiple industries — first and foremost the auto and vehicle manufacturers,” said Matthew Leopold, EPA general counsel during Trump’s first term.

Leopold added that the finding was “one of the most costly regulatory regimes we’ve ever had in this country” and “it directly impacted the cost of vehicles, both passenger automobiles and heavy-duty trucks.”

“There will be no more tailpipe emissions requirements for greenhouse gases,” said Leopold, who noted that pollutants like carbon monoxide will still be subject to emissions standards.

“They’re returning to a historic understanding of the Clean Air Act and the types of pollutants that in their view that the Act was intended to regulate … What’s being disputed is this novel use of the Clean Air Act to expand to greenhouse gases.”

Obama himself led criticism of the announcement.

“Today, the Trump administration repealed the endangerment finding: the ruling that served as the basis for limits on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules,” the 44th president tweeted. “Without it, we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”





Thursday’s action is likely to face legal challenges that stall implementation of the rollback.

The Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 that greenhouse gases such qualify as pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The George W. Bush administration, however, chose not to regulate them. Obama then did so upon taking office in 2009, setting the stage for the current struggle.

It’s conceivable that environmental groups or state governments will attempt to challenge the repeal — citing scientific consensus about climate change and its associated potential economic and health impacts.

Many regulations already were in the process of getting axed by the Trump administration — such as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, established in 2009 to require power plants, refineries, chemical manufacturers, waste facilities and other industries to track and report their carbon dioxide emissions to the EPA.

Other policies pushed by former President Joe Biden — including the so-called Clean Power Plan 2.0, meant to lower emissions from existing US power plants, particularly coal-powered facilities — are expected to be scrapped as a direct result of the endangerment repeal.

Zeldin and Trump singled out one practical impact of Thursday’s announcement: The looming absence of the car feature that switches engines off while drivers are idling at stop lights.

“Under the endangerment finding, they forced the hated start-stop feature onto American consumers, which unnecessarily shuts off a car’s engine when you stop at a red light. In other words, the engine goes off. That’s great,” Trump said.

Zeldin also said that “manufacturers will no longer be burdened by measuring, compiling or reporting greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles and engines.”

The Sierra Club, a prominent environmental group, claimed Trump and Zeldin were trying to “turn back the clock to the 19th century” and pledged “we will do everything in our power to block this misguided effort.”

The National Wildlife Federation said the rollback “undermines our country’s ability to protect people and wildlife from harmful air pollution and the impacts of a changing climate.”

Trump said, however, that the EPA is taking aim at “ environmental nonsense” — though the tariff-loving president suggested at one point that he would be open to leaving burdensome regulations in place for foreign imports.

“It will probably make it so that any of that equipment built in the United States will not have to go through this,” Trump said. “If it’s built outside, I think we’ll probably leave the standard the same. If people are going to send us equipment, let them have that standard, for whatever it’s worth, which is not much.”

Text: The Trump administration repealed a key defense in the U.S. fight against climate change — and it will likely have far-reaching impacts on people's finances, according to experts on the economic effects of global warming.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday overturned the "endangerment finding," a cornerstone of U.S. climate policy since the Obama era.

The finding underpins the federal government's legal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet.

Experts have said the change is the Trump administration's most aggressive move yet to hobble U.S. climate policy.

Repealing the endangerment finding leaves the U.S. with fewer ways to curb emissions and increases Americans' exposure to climate damages, Chris Field, director of the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University, said in a September briefing.

President Donald Trump has called climate change a "con job" and a "hoax." But scientists almost universally agree that climate change is real and mainly caused by humans via greenhouse gas emissions.

A warming climate will fuel more extreme weather and events like wildfires, floods, droughts and hurricanes, experts said.

These can have profound financial impacts for households, including higher costs for insurance, relocation, home repair, health care, food, and electricity to heat and cool homes, experts said. Workers may also see smaller paychecks due to missed work days, they said.

Weather-related disasters already cost the U.S. close to $150 billion a year, a sum expected to grow in the near term due to climate change, according to the U.S. government's most recent National Climate Assessment, published in 2023.

"You can't escape the basic physics of climate change," said Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who co-leads the left-leaning think tank's climate and communities practice.

The repeal of the endangerment finding will likely exacerbate the effects of climate change over the longer term, he said.

"It's a very big deal," Rumbach said. "It will have a huge drag" on people's finances, he said.

The EPA endangerment finding has its roots in a 2007 Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. EPA.

In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Justices directed the EPA — which is required to set limits for damaging pollutants — to determine if greenhouse gases endanger public health or welfare.

In December 2009, the Obama administration issued the so-called endangerment finding: That six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.

Since then, the EPA has regulated emissions from automobiles and other vehicles and power plants. Its revocation on Thursday would open the door to challenging those regulations.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on Thursday that the repeal is the "single largest deregulatory action in U.S. history."

The federal agency estimates the move will save Americans more than $1.3 trillion, by eliminating the endangerment finding and "all subsequent federal GHG emission standards for all vehicles and engines of model years 2012 to 2027 and beyond."

The average person would save about $2,400 per vehicle, according to the EPA. The estimate includes the avoidance of costs tied to purchasing equipment for electric vehicles.

Transportation is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for about 28% of the nation's emissions in 2022, according to the most recent EPA data.

Those emissions come primarily from the burning of fossil fuels (like oil and gasoline) for cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes, it said.

"Calling CO2 a pollutant and doing something about it is good for the climate," said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School.

Without the endangerment finding, "emissions will go up, and that means more CO2 in the atmosphere, meaning more intense wildfires, storms, etc.," he said. "That's bad for the rest of us."

"Now the big question is: What is the chance of this holding up in court?" he said.

Climate change is fueling more weather and climate disasters in the U.S. — and those disasters have grown more costly over time, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

From 1980 to 2023, the U.S. experienced nine disasters each year that caused more than $1 billion in damage apiece, according to NOAA data published in 2025. However, the frequency of costly disasters increased to an average of 23 per year over the five years from 2020 to 2024, NOAA found.

An American born in 2024 can expect to pay about $500,000 during their lifetime as a result of climate change's financial impacts, according to a study from that same year by ICF, a consulting firm.

For example, climate change will increase the risk of property damage from floods and wildfires throughout the 21st century, the Congressional Budget Office wrote in a 2024 report.

"Property owners, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, and the federal government will bear losses due to floods and wildfires," CBO wrote. "If those losses led to cascading failures of financial institutions, they would undermine the financial system.

Home insurers are raising rates to unaffordable levels for many consumers, and some insurers are abandoning certain markets altogether, experts said.

In Florida, for example, a state prone to hurricanes, the average annual homeowners insurance premium is close to $6,000, more than double the national average, according to a 2024 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Nationwide, homeowners insurance premiums rose 40% faster than inflation from 2017 to 2022, with climate risk a primary culprit, the report said.

Extreme weather can also impact household cash flow due to lost work days, experts said.

Wildfire smoke, for example, reduces earnings for workers in sectors like manufacturing, crop production, utilities, health care, real estate, administration and transportation, according to a 2022 study by economists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Oregon.

On average, workers' foregone earnings totaled $125 billion a year between 2007 and 2019, the economists found.

Among other impacts, a higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could also mean "more cases of asthma and heart disease linked to poor air quality, higher food prices from climate-stressed crops, and economic losses as U.S. companies fall behind in global clean-tech markets," Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment wrote in an explainer about the endangerment finding.

In the shorter run, auto efficiency standards could fall as a result of the overturned endangerment finding, said Urban Institute's Rumbach. Consumers might save money on a car purchase, to the extent automakers are able to produce cheaper vehicles, he said.

However, consumers may give back those savings over the vehicle's lifetime, relative to a more-efficient car like an electric vehicle, said Rumbach. Researchers have found that certain consumers save money over the long term on EVs relative to traditional gas-powered cars due to lower fueling and maintenance costs, for example.

Text: 





















Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Thursday asserted that he will “not budge” and will continue to speak up for farmers regardless of any legal or parliamentary action against him, following a notice from Bharatiya Janata MP Nishikant Dubey seeking his expulsion through a substantive motion.

“Narendra Modi has sold the country and its farmers,” Gandhi said in a video posted on social media. “You put cases against me, abuse me. Do whatever you want, file a privilege motion, it does not matter to me, I have spoken the truth in Parliament, you may not like it, that is a different matter, but the country knows the truth.”

He accused Modi of being “anti-farmer”, and of “selling” the interests of the country in the trade deal with the United States.

Gandhi has alleged that in the recently-announced trade deal, the BJP-led Union government compromised India’s energy security and harmed farmers’ interests.

FIR हो,मुकदमा दर्ज हो या Privilege प्रस्ताव लाएं - मैं किसानों के लिए लड़ूंगा।जो भी ट्रेड डील किसानों की रोज़ी-रोटी छीने या देश की खाद्य सुरक्षा को कमजोर करे, वह किसान-विरोधी है।अन्नदाताओं के हितों से किसान-विरोधी मोदी सरकार को समझौता नहीं करने देंगे। pic.twitter.com/gNVMEYFp3i

On Thursday, Dubey submitted a notice for a substantive motion against Gandhi for allegedly “fomenting public sentiments” in Parliament through foreign funding.


In his notice, the BJP MP said that Gandhi has engaged with the Soros Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development, and travelled to countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the US to take part in “anti-India activities”.

Dubey alleged in the notice that Gandhi has “very cleverly…captured the most pious dais of Parliament to foment public sentiments, levelling unsubstantiated allegations…against the Election Commission…[and] Supreme Court…lowering the dignity of the government without any substantive evidence and putting various other institutions in bad light”.


Gandhi, participating in the debate on the Union Budget on Wednesday, alleged that the BJP-led Union government had “sold Bharat Mata” through the trade deal between India and the United States.

Text: 





















Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey on Thursday said that he has submitted a notice in the Lok Sabha to initiate a substantive motion against Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi for allegedly “fomenting public sentiments” in Parliament through foreign funding, reported The Indian Express.


Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Dubey said that he has sought the cancellation of Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership. “He should be debarred from contesting the election for a lifetime,” The Indian Express quoted him as saying.

Dubey also said that he had not moved a privilege motion against Gandhi.

A privilege motion is brought when a member believes that the privileges of the House or of its members have been breached. It is examined by the speaker. If admitted, it may be referred to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry.

In his notice, the BJP MP said that Gandhi has engaged with the Soros Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development, and travelled to countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the United States to take part in “anti-India activities”, The Indian Express reported.

Dubey alleged in the notice that Gandhi has “very cleverly…captured the most pious dais of Parliament to foment public sentiments, levelling unsubstantiated allegations…against the Election Commission…[and] Supreme Court…lowering the dignity of the government without any substantive evidence and putting various other institutions in bad light”, the newspaper reported.


Dubey said that Gandhi’s “relentless and well-choreographed actions, within and outside Parliament, are inimical to our country”, The Indian Express reported.

In response, Congress leader KC Venugopal told the newspaper that Dubey’s move was an attempt to divert attention from the matters Gandhi had raised. “It’s self-defence for the BJP,” The Indian Express quoted Venugopal as saying.

On Wednesday, Gandhi participated in the debate on the Union Budget. He alleged that the BJP-led Union government had “sold Bharat Mata” through the trade deal between India and the United States.










The former Army chief wrote in his memoir that this implied that the Indian response was to be “purely a military decision” and that “the onus was now totally on [him]”.


BJP MPs had been objecting to the Congress MP speaking on the matter, arguing that he cannot quote from a book that had not yet been released.

Text: Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings has threatened legal action against Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk after Panamanian authorities tapped the group to temporarily take over operations of two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal.

In a statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison warned A.P. Moller-Maersk that "any steps" the Danish group or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely "result in legal recourse." That's according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese statement.

The simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfires.

After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was "running the Panama Canal," CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port subsidiaries. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  "kowtowing" to American pressure and stalling the transaction.

Tensions intensified last month when Panama's Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a CK Hutchison subsidiary to operate the two ports was "unconstitutional." The company pushed back, saying it "strongly disagreed" with the ruling and launched arbitration proceedings against Panama.

CK Hutchison on Thursday also said it had notified Panama of the dispute under an investment protection treaty, saying it would pursue "all available recourse including additional national and international legal proceedings."

APM Terminals, the Maersk subsidiary asked to take over the ports, reportedly said it was not party to the legal dispute and had only offered to step in temporarily "to mitigate the risks that could affect essential services for regional and global trade."

Maersk shares fell over 3% in Copenhagen on Thursday.

The stakes around Panama ports have risen sharply this year. The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities.

In its strongest rebuke yet, Beijing warned on Wednesday that the Central American country "will inevitably pay a heavy price both politically and economically," unless it changes course. Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the court ruling "logically flawed" and "utterly ridiculous."

China also directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and asked shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week.

The standoff may prove more manageable for Washington than it appears, according to Reva Goujon, a director at advisory firm Rhodium Group. The U.S. retains significant leverage through its treaty with Panama, which could allow it to defend any intervention on national security grounds, she said.

But Beijing has claimed a partial victory, by derailing Washington's initial plans to acquire CK Hutchison's global port holdings outright, Goujon said.

China needs to make the U.S. "clawback in Panama as difficult as possible to avoid setting a precedent," Goujon said, noting that Chinese state-owned shipping giant Cosco's Chancay port in Peru — a key infrastructure investment by Beijing in Latin America — is also in U.S. crosshairs.

The U.S. has raised sovereignty concerns over the port of Chancay, a deep-water facility near Lima. In a post on X on Thursday, the U.S. State Department's bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Peru could be "powerless" to oversee the critical port which was "under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners."

For CK Hutchison, the lawfare will likely end in vein, analysts and law experts told CNBC.

"There's little CK Hutchison can do even with behind-the-scenes support from Beijing," Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors.

Any legal claims — including wrongful interference with property — will ultimately hinge on whether CK Hutchison's port concession is considered "live" or formally terminated, said Shahla Ali, a professor specializing in arbitration laws at the University of Hong Kong.

The duration of Maersk's control over the ports will also be scrutinized, said Ali, who views the recent legal notice as "a deterrent" to keep the door open for further negotiation.

The Panama canal — a crucial trade passage that links the Atlantic and Pacific – handles roughly 40% of all U.S. container traffic each year. CK Hutchison's subsidiary, Panama Ports Co., has operated them since 1997 and received a 25-year agreement renewal in 2021.

The canal was built in the early 20th century by the U.S. which operated it for decades before handing full control to Panama in 1999.

Analysts expected the dispute to drag on, potentially straining U.S.-China relations, already frayed by one year of tariff tensions, Beijing's tightened grip on rare earth exports, disputes over Taiwan and Washington's restrictions on tech exports.

CK Hutchison said Thursday that the continued operation of the two ports "depends solely on actions of the Panama Supreme Court and the Panamanian State," which it cannot control.

Text: A record-breaking number of companies shipping products into the United States are coming up short on a federal government requirement to financially guarantee they can cover the import trade duties triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

And this is leading to a record amount of money paid to the U.S. to cover the shortfalls.

U.S. Customs data shared with CNBC shows that what are called customs bond "insufficiencies" reached a total of 27,479 in fiscal 2025, with the combined value soaring to almost $3.6 billion. It is the highest number of bond insufficiencies and the highest total value across insufficiencies ever recorded. In fact, it doubles the 2019 level when tariffs enacted by President Trump under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also fueled bond shortfalls.

"Bonds are the primary tool used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to safeguard the revenue of the United States and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations," said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.

Under U.S. Customs' guidelines, the agency continuously reviews bond adequacy, and a bond is flagged as being insufficient when an importer's duty/tax liability exceeds 100% of their current bond capacity. The record shortfall comes at a time of record tariff revenue for the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.

"In totality, it makes sense that insufficiencies are more than double," said Jennifer Diaz, attorney at Diaz Trade Law. "Many companies take it for granted that a $50,000 bond should be able to cover you for a one-year period," she said. "But it might not. They are not utilizing set calculations, and don't have anyone in their corner telling them that their bond obligation is higher."

International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million.

Importers buy customs bonds, also known as surety bonds, through specialized insurance companies known as surety companies. The bonds are issued approximately 30 days before imports arrive in the U.S. to ensure that Customs collects the requisite tariffs in the event an importer does not pay its obligation. The bonds are held for 314 days by Customs in accounts that bear no interest. During this time, duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive final government sign-off.

U.S. importers pay a premium to insure their bonds. The premium is typically 1% of the bond limit, with the price of the bonds covering 10% of the duties and taxes paid over a rolling 12-month period. If tariffs and taxes go up, the customs bond requirement goes up as well.

Surety companies have told CNBC they have seen bond increases upwards of 200%. "In one unusual case, a large auto manufacturing client saw its custom bond amount increase by 550%," Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC.

If the bond is insufficient, the importer can't get the freight, and it is held by Customs until the bond meets requirements. To address the shortfall, importers need to have another bond issued and that can take at least 10 days.

In addition to the bonds, companies rely on related collateral to guarantee trade duty coverage. "If companies do not increase their collateral, the goods will be stopped at the port," Moy said. The collateral is held by the insurance company that issues the bond for the 314-day period dictated by U.S. Customs. Companies have told CNBC that the tariff-triggered bond insufficiencies have created additional strain on their relationships with customs brokers.

The Supreme Court could soon rule on President Trump's IEEPA tariffs, deciding if they are legal. Feb. 20 is the next date for a potential decision and U.S. importers may be in line for not only trade tax refunds but also the money laid out for customs bonds and related collateral. If tariffs are refunded, the bond amounts associated with those imports can be used to reduce to levels sufficient to cover the duties, taxes, and fees. Companies will need to petition the insurer that issued the bond for a reduction of the bond and collateral. Trade experts tell CNBC importers should be ready if this happens.

Surety companies tell CNBC importers should expect some lag time in receiving these funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.

Artificial intelligence is having a moment. And in markets, that usually means someone else is having a rough week.

The latest victims of the technology are real estate, trucking and logistics stocks, joining financial and software-as-a-service stocks in plunging on AI fears.

Office towers could soon be empty, according to Elon Musk, who made the comments on a podcast last week, as AI replaces workers. It's a point echoed in an essay by OtherSide AI co-founder and CEO Matt Shumer, who argued that AI could eradicate entry-level, white-collar jobs. If fewer people clock in, fewer leases get signed.

In freight, the pressure was more concrete. AI company Algorhythm Holdings released a tool it claims allows operators to scale freight volumes by 300% to 400% without hiring more employees. That prospect was enough to send trucking and logistics stocks plummeting.

"We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labor-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption," Jade Rahmani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a note Wednesday.

Not every balance sheet is under siege. Japan's SoftBank said it added $4.2 billion in value to its OpenAI investment, which helped boost its Vision Fund by $2.4 billion in the December quarter.

AI was also the centerpiece of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's 2026 budget announcement. The city-state will launch a "national AI council," support firms that want to harness AI and provide citizens who undergo select courses with six months of free access to advanced AI tools.

Separately, CK Hutchinson Holdings on Thursday said that it would take "legal recourse" against APM Terminals, an affiliate of Danish shipping giant Maersk, if it takes over its operations at the Balboa or Cristobal ports in Panama. A CK Hutchinson subsidiary currently runs those ports, but Panama's Supreme Court recently ruled to void the firm's license, a move widely viewed as a victory for the Trump administration.

Anthropic closed a $30 billion funding round at a $380 billion post-money valuation. That's more than double what the AI company was worth in September and is the second-largest private tech fundraising round on record, after OpenAI.

Apple had its worst day since April, with its stock falling 5% on Thursday and down almost 4% for 2026. Reports of delays with Siri and regulatory scrutiny over the company's news app weighed on shares.

The U.S. consumer price index is due Friday and is expected to show a 2.5% gain from a year ago, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast for the January release.

Major U.S. benchmarks retreated Thursday, with the S&P 500 falling 1.57%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.34% and the Nasdaq Composite slumping 2.03%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 fell 0.49% amid earnings from Siemens, Hermès and Mercedes-Benz Group.

[PRO] How will the U.S. CPI move markets? The S&P 500 could lose as much as 2.5% or jump 1.7% depending on what the core month-on-month numbers look like, according to JPMorgan Chase.

Safe-haven currencies might not be so safe after a volatile year. Here's how the market is rethinking the Swiss franc, dollar and yen

Ask an investor to name safe-haven currencies, and most will say the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen. Investors historically expected them to hold their value during geopolitical or economic turbulence.
