Title: ‘India scores low on partner satisfaction, but ranks 8th for romance, intimacy’

Text: India may be home to centuries-old love poetry, temple carvings celebrating intimacy, and the world’s most quoted ancient text on desire,  but when it comes to modern relationship satisfaction, the picture is more complex.

According to the Ipsos Valentine’s Day survey, conducted across 29 global markets, India ranks lowest in partner satisfaction and sits among the bottom three countries on the Love Life Satisfaction Index 2026.

Reason? “There is a notable gap between relationship expectations and lived experiences among Indian respondents,” reveals the survey.

The Love Life Satisfaction Index is not a vague, feel-good metric. It combines three specific dimensions: satisfaction with the love in one’s life, satisfaction with one’s sex life, and satisfaction with one’s relationship with a spouse or partner.

In other words, it attempts to measure not just romance or chemistry, but emotional connection, physical intimacy and relational stability together. And here’s where the paradox begins.

Two in three Indians (67%) describe their relationship with their spouse or partner as loving. That’s not a small number. In absolute terms, a majority report positive emotional connection.

Yet when compared globally, India ranks lowest on partner satisfaction. It also falls among the bottom three markets when respondents were asked whether they feel loved.

That gap — between “my relationship is loving” and “I feel loved” — may be subtle, but it is significant. It hints at something deeper than relationship status: perceived emotional reciprocity.

Ipsos India CEO Suresh Ramalingam cautions against reading the findings as a crisis. “Two in three Indians report being satisfied with their love life. The ranking is relative across markets and should be interpreted in context,” he notes.

India’s ranking feels jarring against its global image. The land of the Kamasutra, Bollywood romance and elaborate wedding rituals is culturally synonymous with passion and intimacy.

But modern love doesn’t unfold in mythology.

Multi-generational family systems, rising work pressures, dual-income households, shifting gender roles and evolving expectations within marriages may all shape how people experience emotional fulfilment today. Balancing caregiving, careers and partnership leaves less space for overt affirmation — even if affection exists. Love may be present. But is it felt and expressed?

Interestingly, India performs far better when it comes to romance and sex life satisfaction. The country ranks 8th overall among 29 markets on this dimension — ahead of several Western nations.

Thailand and Indonesia lead the category, followed by Mexico, Spain, Malaysia, Colombia, Peru, India and Argentina.

This contrast suggests something important: emotional validation and physical intimacy do not always move together. People may feel reasonably satisfied with romance and sexual connection, yet still report lower levels of feeling emotionally affirmed.

Thailand tops the overall Love Life Satisfaction Index in 2026, with respondents reporting high satisfaction across all three dimensions. Countries across Asia, Latin America and parts of Europe dominate the upper tier.

At the bottom sit Japan, South Korea and India. Even Italy and France — long associated with romance — appear in the bottom ten, proving that cultural stereotypes don’t always mirror lived experience.

Across 29 markets, income appears to influence love life satisfaction. Eighty-two per cent of high-income respondents say they are satisfied with the love in their life, compared to 72% of low-income respondents. When it comes to romantic and sex life satisfaction, the gap widens to 14 percentage points.

Money may not buy love, but financial stability seems to reduce stressors that strain relationships. The survey, based on over 23,000 respondents globally, including around 2,200 in India, ultimately reveals that love is multi-dimensional. Emotional fulfilment, romance and physical intimacy are distinct — and sometimes misaligned. For India, the findings are less about a deficit of love and more about evolving expectations. In a rapidly changing society, how love is expressed — and how it is perceived — may be shifting just as quickly.

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 01:31 AM

BUENOS AIRES, Feb 12 - Argentina's Senate approved President Javier Milei's flagship labor reform bill early on Thursday, marking a key advance for the libertarian leader's sweeping economic agenda.

After debating the measure for more than 13 hours, lawmakers voted 42 to 30 to pass the reform and send it to the lower house for debate, a victory for Milei's administration, which argues the overhaul will spur investment and formal job creation.

The Senate's approval of the reform is expected to encourage investors who are watching to see whether Milei has the power to continue implementing his free-market agenda.

"This law represents a turning point in Argentine labor history," Milei said in a statement after the vote, calling it a "profound transformation" that would reduce bureaucracy and update regulations he described as outdated in the face of economic and technological change.

Opposition Peronist senators had fought against the reform, arguing that the package threatens long-standing worker protections.

The reform eases hiring rules, changes the vacation time system, allows for extending the standard workday from eight to 12 hours and for salaries to be paid in foreign currency.

It also introduces new limits on the right to strike by setting minimum requirements for services to continue during work stoppages. The reform streamlines the calculation of severance pay, lowering costs for employers by excluding bonuses that were not part of a worker’s regular salary from the compensation formula.

Lawmakers made adjustments to the bill before its passage, including the removal of a provision that would have cut income tax rates to 31% from 35%, a change sought by provincial governors.

The reform kept a requirement in place for employers to be responsible for the automatic collection of union dues, a concession to labor groups to avoid weakening their finances.

The government also removed a clause that would have allowed workers to be paid through virtual wallets following pushback from traditional banks.

Protesters hurled Molotov cocktails and clashed with police outside Congress during the debate on Wednesday, though city services were largely interrupted in Buenos Aires.

The bill will be next be debated and voted on by the lower house. REUTERS

Text: President Donald Trump invited Argentina’s Javier Milei and other allied regional heads of state to a summit on March 7 Summit to discuss stopping China’s encroachment in the region, Argentine outlets reported on Wednesday.

Official Argentine government sources told the newspapers Clarín and La Nación that the summit will take place on Miami, Florida. In addition to Milei, the sources said that President Trump also invited Paraguay’s Santiago Peña, Bolivia’s Rodrigo Paz, El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa, and Honduras’s recently-inaugurated President Nasry Asfura to join him on the March 7 event — all of whom lead governments with friendly ties with the United States.

According to Infobae, the summit’s objective is to “break Xi Jinping’s plan to control natural resources, food production, and major trade routes in Latin America.”

“From this perspective, the White House will attempt, with its Latin American allies, to block all contracts favorable to China that involve increasing its reserves of critical minerals, strengthening its food security, facilitating its military intelligence capabilities, and developing infrastructure that facilitates its international trade,” Infobae reported.

La Nación detailed that, although Milei has not yet confirmed his attendance, he is expected to accept the invite given his staunch alliance with President Trump and due to the fact that the summit would occur two days before the start of “Argentina Week,” an investment fair hosted by New York from March 9 to 11 that Milei is expected to join.

Although reports have not disclosed further details on the summit, the Argentine outlets detailed that the gathering between President Trump and the group of regional U.S.-allied heads of state is part of Trump’s “Donroe Doctrine” strategy.

“Trump’s strategy is to give key importance to the Western Hemisphere in order to slow China’s advance. He has outlined his project in a revamped Monroe Doctrine, which he has renamed ‘Donroe,’ where he places the focus on our region for trade, investment, and access to strategic minerals,” Clarín wrote.

Infobae asserted that the reported Miami summit “will highlight the ideological divide in Latin America” between Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, El Salvador, Honduras, and Ecuador — whose governments have allied themselves with the United States — and Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, which “have fluid trade relations with China and do not question its authoritarian approach to exercising power.” The Argentine outlet reported that, with less than four weeks until the event, “it cannot be ruled out that the White House will send further invitations to Latin American leaders who have good relations with Washington.”

Last week, the United States hosted the 2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial, a gathering of over 50 countries during which Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the launch of the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE). At the same time, Vice President JD Vance called upon the creation of a preferential critical minerals trade bloc to loosen China’s grip on the important resources. During the encounter, Argentina, Paraguay, and Ecuador joined other countries in signing critical mineral memorandums of understanding with the United States.

Milei praised President Trump as an “example of courage and leadership” speaking on a video message at the Hispanic Prosperity Gala, an event hosted by the Latino Wall Street at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Milei was initially scheduled to attend the event in person and receive the Economic Freedom Award from the event’s organizers, but cancelled his attendance due to scheduling conflicts.

This month, the United States and Argentina signed an Agreement on Reciprocal Trade and Investment (ARTI), granting U.S. goods preferential market access to Argentina in a wide array of areas.

QUANTITY: in acres
TIME: a matter of minutes, the same minute and a half
</entities>
Text: The key takeaway from Craig Fulton’s first interaction with the media after becoming India’s head coach was that his philosophy is ‘defend to win’. He has insisted that he has always tried to instil defensive structure into his players, and it has reaped rewards. He reiterated the same when assessing the 1-3 defeat against Belgium a day earlier: “We normally pride ourselves on defence, but it wasn’t how we like it.”

Precisely for this reason, what unfolded in front of his eyes at the Birsa Munda Stadium would have frustrated him. India’s defence went missing in a barely believable first half where they conceded seven goals before eventually losing 0-8 against Argentina. The Pro League isn’t always treated as the most important event in the calendar by the world’s best teams, but a nightmare performance at the start of a massive year for Indian hockey is a serious cause for concern.

While Argentina were indeed clinical with their finishing – with Tomas Domene smashing four goals in a stellar display – almost every single goal that India conceded stemmed from a soft defensive error. “If we made a mistake, we got punished and if they made a mistake, we didn’t punish them,” Fulton summarised in the mixed zone.

In hindsight, it might not have made much of a difference. India’s defence and ball retention were poor. But it didn’t help the hosts that Harmanpreet Singh missed a Penalty Stroke, not once but twice, at the end of the opening quarter. After a brilliant nutmeg and turn by Aditya Lalage at the edge of the circle, which resulted in a rash foul that led to the stroke, the Indian captain’s first attempt was saved by Tomas Santiago. When Harmanpreet was awarded a retake on review because of Santiago’s early movement, he went again to the goalkeeper’s right and saw his shot blocked.

India would be made to pay for the missed opportunity rather quickly. Argentina went down the other end and took the lead, thanks to a stunning finish from Tomas Ruiz, who hammered a loose ball into the roof of the net with a fierce backhander. Argentina doubled their lead immediately, after a botched Penalty Corner routine was converted into a goal by the awareness of Domene, who made space for a shot and guided one past Suraj Karkera on the turn. From nearly taking the lead, India stared down a 0-2 deficit in a matter of minutes.

“We certainly were in the right place, we were playing well, and the momentum shift changed massively from us trying to get a goal, we conceded two in the same minute and a half. And then we didn’t handle it well after that. That wasn’t good from us,” Fulton reflected later.

India’s troubles compounded early in the second quarter. A long pass from Maico Casella into the circle was missed by Nilam Sanjeep Xess as Domene lost his marker, turned sharply and simply passed it past Pawan in goal. Argentina’s fourth was a shambolic piece of miscommunication in Indian defence. Sukhjeet Singh made a harmless back pass to Nilam who in turn tried to find Harmanpreet but mishit straight to the opposition, setting up an easy 1-vs-1 situation for Lucio Mendez.

It became 5-0 as Ignacio Ibarra found himself in acres of space down the left, dribbled into the circle and hit a powerful reverse hit on goal from a tight angle, from which Pawan shouldn’t have been beaten, but he let the ball in through the pads. The sixth goal was almost a mirror image of the fourth; this time, the mistake happened on the left flank. Sanjay’s pass to Hardik Singh was underhit and a simple through ball forward put Domene clean through on goal. Pawan rushed out but was beaten far too easily by the Argentine top scorer. And just before half time, India conceded the seventh after giving away a tame Penalty Corner, Domene then converting with the help of a deflection.

There was a hint of control in the second half as India held possession longer, but the best chances were still being created by Argentina, who missed a couple of great chances to net their eighth, but eventually did score it through a counterattack led by Domene after Harmanpreet missed an interception.

Fulton is not a man for overreaction, but he’d know deep down that the scoreline is inexcusable, irrespective of the squad rotation that he alluded to in post-match comments. There are bigger goals for the year, but in the here and now, conceding eight cannot be brushed under the carpet.

Scorers for Argentina: Tomas Domene (15’, 20’, 26’, 60’), Tomas Ruiz (14’), Lucio Mendez (22’), Ignacio Ibarra (25′), Nicolas della Torre (30’)

Text: NICOSIA, February 12. /TASS/. Russian peacekeepers are doing "excellent work" to help the UN mission to Cyprus in fulfilling its tasks, the UN envoy to the island, Khassim Diagne, said.

"The Russian Federation officers serving in UNFICYP are doing an excellent work in various functions in the mission headquarters," said Diagne, the UN secretary-general’s special envoy to the island, who doubles as the head of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).

"I am very pleased with their commitment, dedication and contribution for many, many years to UNFICYP mandate which as you know is to monitor the ceasefire line, manage the buffer zone that separates Turkish-Cypriot side from Greek-Cypriot side but also engaging in intercommunal activities and contributing efforts towards the peace in Cyprus," the UN official told a TASS correspondent after a medal ceremony honoring 50 men and women serving in UNFICYP as military officers.

"So, all in all that I can say is that I am really-really grateful to the Russian Federation," he added.

Medals were awarded to servicemen from 12 countries: Russia, Austria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Canada, Mongolia, Paraguay, Serbia and Slovakia.

Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Murat Zyazikov, who was present at the ceremony, told TASS that Russian servicemen and police officers are performing their tasks as part of UNFICYP with excellence.

Text: The official X account of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace announced on Thursday that Israel has joined the international organization as a founding member.

With that, Israel is now among 27 other countries that are members of the Council: the United States, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Paraguay, Pakistan, Morocco, Mongolia, Kuwait, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Indonesia, Hungary, Egypt, El Salvador, Cambodia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Bahrain, Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Argentina.

The Board of Peace officially launched its account on X in late January. Its only posts so far have been to welcome the member countries.

The Board of Peace, which was founded as part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, had been launched the previous week in a special ceremony led by Trump during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

A week before that, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he has accepted Trump’s invitation and will join the initiative.

Despite Israel now being an official member, the Prime Minister's Office announced earlier on Thursday that Netanyahu will not be attending the first meeting of the Board of Peace, which is scheduled for next week in Washington. Netanyahu has just returned from Washington, where he met at the White House with Trump.
