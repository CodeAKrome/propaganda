  - **Antelope Reef** in the Paracel Islands (only 250 mi east of Vietnam) is also being militarized, according to satellite imagery analyzed by the **Asia Maritime Transparency Institute (AMTI)** in late January.  
  - AMTI warns that China’s radar upgrades on Fiery Cross Reef and other reefs could allow Beijing to “contest the use of the electromagnetic spectrum” in conflict.  
  - Chinese President **Xi Jinping** confirmed, via a video Lunar New‑Year greeting to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), that the **PLA Cyberspace Force** operates a cyber‑warfare facility on **Fiery Cross Reef** in the Spratly Islands.  
  - Fiery Cross Reef (Yongshu Jiao) is a disputed feature claimed by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. China has expanded the reef and built permanent installations after the 1974 war, presenting them as “harmless marine research facilities” while critics accuse it of environmental damage.  
  - International tribunal rulings have largely favored these countries, but China has continued to fortify its positions, expanding islands to support permanent installations.
  - The Chinese “floating walls” strategy—hundreds of fishing boats arranged to block shipping—could support a future blockade or invasion of Taiwan by disrupting maritime traffic and overwhelming surveillance.
  - The Cyberspace Force’s display of battlefield‑intelligence and drone‑countermeasure gear at the 2025 parade suggests a focus on electronic warfare, raising concerns about potential use against shipping lanes in the South China Sea.  
  - The existence of the Cyberspace Force had not been publicly confirmed until its appearance in the **2023 Victory Day parade**; analysts believe it was formally established as a distinct PLA unit in **2024**.  
  - Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan all maintain competing claims over the Spratlys and Paracels.
