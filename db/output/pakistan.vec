Text: Aditya Dhar clearly struck gold with the gangster actioner Dhurandhar, which not only created a storm at the box office domestically but is also trending globally. Since its release on Netflix, the film has been enjoying repeated viewings, and social media is flooded with fan-made edits and tributes. Starring Ranveer Singh in the lead role, Dhurandhar was officially banned in Pakistan. Yet, thanks to piracy, it has found its way there illegally. Recently, Karl Rock, a New Zealand-based YouTuber and blogger known for his travel vlogs across the Indian subcontinent and his book How to Travel in India, shared a new vlog exploring underground piracy hubs in Pakistan. In it, he discovered that Dhurandhar was being sold at remarkably low prices.

In a roughly 30-minute vlog, Karl visited Karachi’s Rainbow Centre in Saddar Bazaar, a market that isn’t just known for gaming but also as a backbone of Pakistan’s black-market entertainment economy.  While speaking to various vendors, Karl came across a shop where a Dhurandhar poster was displayed on a desktop. He asked the shopkeeper, “This is a new film from India, right?” The shopkeeper confirmed, “Yes, this is a new movie from India, Dhurandhar.” When Karl pointed to Ranveer Singh on the poster and asked if it was him, the shopkeeper nodded in agreement.

Turning to his audience, Karl added, “And I can tell you one or two things about Ranveer Singh. He is a Sindhi. His parents, or rather his grandparents, are from this city, I think, and they came over to India during the Partition. Yes, very famous Sindhi guy from India.” When Karl asked the price, the shopkeeper said, “It’s for Rs 50.” Surprised, Karl replied, “That’s it? Very cheap.” The shopkeeper explained that the film costs Rs 50 on a USB, but if you want it on DVD, it would be around Rs 300.

Earlier, when Dhurandhar released in December last year, it was banned in parts of the Middle East. Reports from IANS indicated that the film had been illegally downloaded at least 2 million times in Pakistan within just two weeks, making it the most pirated movie in the country, surpassing even Rajinikanth’s 2.0 and Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees. The film’s overseas distributor, also Pranab Kapadia, spoke about the commercial impact of the ban to CNN News 18:

“I think this is at least a ten million dollar box office that we have lost, because traditionally action films have always performed very well in the Middle East. And therefore we feel that it should have gotten a release. But, at the same time, we have to respect the views and the rules and regulations of every territory and every country, and they have their reasons. We are not the first film where they have not given a release. Fighter also was not released before this, and several others. So we of course made a full attempt at ensuring that we put our best foot forward for the release. But I think ultimately, the film has found its audience, if not in the Gulf, then elsewhere.”

Text: The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has claimed victory in the country's landmark election, with party chairman, Tarique Rahman, set to become the next prime minister. Follow here.

Welcome to DW's coverage of Bangladesh's national election on February 12 and 13:

Tarique Rahman, Bangladesh Nationalist Party's (BNP) prime ministerial candidate, looks set to become the country's next leader after the party claimed a "decisive victory" on Friday.

Rahman, 60, is the eldest son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and former President Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP.

He returned home in December after more than 17 years in self-imposed exile following mass protests in 2024 that toppled longtime premier Sheikh Hasina.

Rahman has served as the party's acting chairman since his mother's imprisonment in 2018, who died shortly after his return in December.

Read more about Tarique Rahman here.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday congratulated Tarique Rahman, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, on his "resounding" election victory.

"I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of elections," Sharif posted on X, adding that he looked forward to working closely with the new leadership to promote bilateral relations and advance shared goals.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated BNP chief Tarique Rahman on Friday on his "decisive victory" and said New Delhi would support "a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh."

"This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership," Modi said in a post on X, referring to Rahman.

"I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals."

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) claimed a landslide victory in the first elections held since the 2024 student-led uprising, with leader Tarique Rahman positioned to become prime minister.

Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in self-exile in London. He is the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December.

The BNP's media unit said that the party had won enough seats in parliament to govern on its own.

Final results have not yet been announced by the Election Commission, but a BNP victory is being widely reported in local media outlets.

"This victory was expected. It is not surprising that the people of Bangladesh have placed their trust in a party... capable of realising the dreams that our youth envisioned during the uprising," Salahuddin Ahmed, a leading BNP committee member, told the AFP news agency.

The United States ambassador to Bangladesh has congratulated the Bangladesh Nationalist Party on what he said was its "historic victory."

"Congratulations to the people of Bangladesh on a successful election and to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Tarique Rahman on your historic victory," Ambassador Brent T. Christensen said in a post on X.

"The United States looks forward to working with you to realize shared goals of prosperity and security for both our countries," the diplomat added.

Results are not yet official, and counting continues for a total of the 299 constituencies of 300 in which voting took place.


Broadcasters in Bangladesh are projecting that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is heading for a landslide win.

Jamuna TV, a private broadcaster, reported that the BNP had secured 211 seats, pushing well past the 150-seat threshold for a clear majority in the 300-seat parliament.

The Islamist-led coalition headed by Jamaat-e-Islami was reported to have won 70 seats, broadcasters projected, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for.

BNP election committee spokesman Mahdi Amin told reporters that the party was on track to win at least two-thirds of seats.

"Buoyed by strong public support, the BNP will secure a two-thirds majority and form the government," Amin said, adding that party chief Tarique Rahman had won "both seats" he had run in.

Final results have not yet been released by the Election Commission and it is suggesting it will have those ready by late Friday morning.

Bangladesh's Election Commission said results are likely to be clear by Friday morning local time — but one party has taken a clear lead already.

Preliminary results showed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) far ahead of its main rival, the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami.

A BNP victory would see party leader Tarique Rahman become the next prime minister. Rahman is the son of the former late prime minister Khaleda Zia.

With his party on the cusp of victory, Rahman called for restraint and asked party supporters not to organize any victory rallies for the time being, The Daily Star reported.

Meanwhile, the Awami League of Bangladesh's ousted former leader Sheikh Hasina was banned from contesting the election after its crackdown against student protesters in 2024. It expressed bitterness about the vote from the sidelines.

Senior figures inside the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) hailed the party's strong showing as results continue to roll in.

Early data showed that the BNP had won more than half of the seats in the 300-seat parliament.

“With the people’s love, BNP will form the government with two-thirds majority," Mahdi Amin, an adviser to party leader Tarique Rahman, told reporters.

"Based on constituency-wise results and unofficial data, we’re confident of our victory."

BNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury described the result as a "landslide."

"Of course, BNP is winning, the majority of course, and it would even be a landslide victory," he said.

"Winning two-thirds of the seats is called a landslide victory, I think we would cross ‌the 200-seat limit."

The leader of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party  indicated he was prepared to concede the election as the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party reportedly enjoyed a strong lead.

Shafiqur ​Rahman told reporters that his party would not pursue a "politics of opposition" for the sake of it.

"We will do positive politics," he added.

However, Rahman did not not formally admit defeat. The vote count remains underway.

The party of Bangladesh's ousted former leader decried the election as a "well-planned farce."

On a post on X, the Awami League accused interim leader Mohammed Yunus of usurping power and said people's voting rights were "completely disregarded" in the election.

Yunus' government last year banned the Awami League from all political activities — including contesting the election — accusing it of "crimes against humanity" in its brutal crackdown on student protesters.

The party still suffers the blowback of the 2024 protests, which ended with Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is on track to rule after winning a simple majority in the 300-seat parliament, according to a projection by the local Ekattor TV channel.

The broadcaster showed BNP winning at least 151 seats by early Friday local time. The BNP's nearest competitor, Jamaat-e-Islami, had secured 42 seats.

If confirmed in the final tally, the next leader of Bangladesh is most likely to be Tarique Rahman, the son of Sheikh Hasina's rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.

With counting underway in Bangladesh, officials from the Election Commission said that clear trends are expected around midnight and that results are likely to be clear by Friday morning local time.

More than 2,000 candidates — including many independents — were on the ballot, and at least 50 parties took part in the process, setting a national record.

The voters were also deciding on a referendum regarding constitutional reforms.

DW correspondent Nimisha Jaiswal snapped this photo at a Dhaka polling station as electoral officials were starting to sort out and count the votes — pink ballots for the referendum on constitutional reforms, and the white ones endorsing would-be lawmakers.

At different polling booths in Dhaka, observers from several political parties told DW the voting had gone smoothly and fairly.

But with those parties claiming irregularities during the election process, there are concerns that the voting was far less smooth at other locations across Bangladesh.

The youth-driven party National Citizen Party (NCP) might not perform as well at the elections as some might have expected, voters and experts in Bangladesh are saying, despite the fact that it was born out of the Gen Z uprising that paved the way for Thursday's vote.

Following the revolution, Bangladeshis had high hopes from its Gen Z as they toppled the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina. People expected them to offer a third alternative to the old guard, as represented for decades by the Awami League and the BNP party.

But soon cracks began to develop in the party. Despite the fact that the protests led by Gen Z were secular and inclusive in nature, its top leadership decided to ally with a right-wing Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami.

Many of its members, especially women, resigned from the party, citing ideological differences with the Islamists. This reduced the credibility of the students' party, observers say.

Another reason that might reduce support for the NCP, according to some, is the leaders' tendency to equate the 2024 uprising with the Bangladeshi War of Independence of 1971.

That war is a highly emotional issue for many in Bangladesh, reminding them of the crimes that were committed during the conflict, including the hundreds and thousands of killings and rapes of women.

Some people say it was arrogant of the NCP party to equate the uprising with the war, which led to Bangladesh achieving independence from Pakistan.

A third reason why support for the NCP is lower than might have been expected is the allegations of corruption against some of its members.

They have prevented the party from taking the moral high ground, with corruption a major issue for voters at the election.

There might be a lesson for the Gen Z party if it is defeated: Toppling a government is one thing, but actually changing a country’s politics is a completely different ball game.

And now, a lot of people can’t help but ask: Did the 2024 uprising and all the sacrifices young people made really mean anything in the end?

Text: The Supreme Court order to examine Khan comes after his attorney told media that the former prime minister had lost most of his vision in his right eye. Khan has been in prison since 2023 due to a graft case conviction.

Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday said the Pakistani government must form a medical team to assess Imran Khan's health, after the imprisoned ex-prime minister reportedly complained of massive vision loss.

Pakistani media reported that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, said "the issue of Imran's health is most important," while adding that "intervention was necessary."

The two-member bench is conducting hearings related to Khan's living conditions in Adiala Jail, which is located in the central-eastern Pakistani province of Punjab.

The court set a February 16 deadline for a medical examination and also said 73-year-old Khan must be allowed contact with his sons, who reside in London.

Khan's attorney, Salman Safdar, met with Khan earlier in the week. Safdar told the Supreme Court that Khan reported vision loss of up to 85% in his right eye due to a blood clot.

Khan's son, Karim Khan, blamed his father's deteriorating health in confinement on "the regime in power, the Army Chief and the puppets enabling their orders, their watch and their responsablity."

"We urge human rights bodies, legal institutions and democratic nations to confront this persecution and ensure those responsible face consequences," Kasim said.


Khan served as Pakistan's prime minister from August 2018 until he was removed via a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022.

A former cricket star, Khan still boasts a massive base of voters and supporters in Pakistan. Khan has blamed the Pakistani military and the US for his removal from power, although Washington denies this allegation.

Khan was put behind bars in 2023 due to his conviction in a graft case. The Pakistani government has also cracked down on Khan's Pakistani Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and pro-PTI protesters.

Text: Bangladesh on Thursday held its first general election since Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by violent riots in August 2024.

Hasina supporters regard the election as tainted, or completely illegitimate, because her party has been outlawed and the former PM was sentenced to death in absentia.

Hasina was one of the leaders toppled by the “Gen Z uprisings” last year, in which large protests led by students and young people revolted against entrenched governments, usually motivated by allegations of corruption. The movement was notable for its international momentum, as protesters in each country studied what the others were doing, emulating their tactics and adopting their symbols.

Hasina had been in power since 2009, but her Awami League party and its political allies had dominated the politics of Bangladesh for most of its existence as an independent country. Her father, Sheikh Mujb Rahma, was the first leader of Bangladesh, but his brief time in office ended when he was killed in a military coup in 1975.

The protest in Bangladesh became much more violent than the other Gen Z demonstrations. It was sparked by pushback from young Bangladeshis against a system of quotas for government jobs, which was designed to favor the “freedom fighters” who fought for independence from Pakistan in the 1970s and their descendants. Hasina responded to the protests with a remarkably brutal crackdown and the overall death toll exceeded 1,400 before she fled into exile in India.

The Bangladeshi Election Commission outlawed the Awami League in May 2025, even though it was still one of the largest parties in the country, and then Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for committing crimes against humanity with her protest crackdown in November. These developments led many of her supporters to view Thursday’s elections as rigged or illegitimate, a position held vocally by Hasina herself.

The elimination of the Awami League proved to be a boon for its old coalition partner, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), whose leader Tarique Rahman is favored to become the next prime minister. Himself the son of a former prime minister, Rahman recently returned to Bangladesh after living in exile in the United Kingdom.

Rahman’s chief opponent is Shafiqur Rahmansaid of Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party that was banned when Hasina was in power but swiftly regained enormous influence after she was ousted by tapping the religious sentiments of Bangladesh’s 90-percent Muslim population. Many of Bangladesh’s 127 million voters are uncomfortable with Jamaat-e-Islami’s reactionary views, however, and prefer Rahman’s promises of a reform agenda.

Early returns on Thursday morning showed a very close race, shaken up by former Awami League voters who appear torn between drifting to BNP or sitting out the election in protest. BNP appeared to be leading in enough seats to take the prime minister’s office, but a large number of votes remained to be counted. Turnout was reportedly huge, with more votes counted by midday on Thursday than were cast in the entire 2024 election.

The election also includes some major referendums, including one that would add a second house to the 350-seat national legislature.

Sky News on Thursday interviewed voters who felt they were participating in the first truly free election in almost two decades, without the heavy hand of Hasina and the Awami League influencing the proceedings. Interim President Mohamed Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, deployed police to protect polling stations and promised to deliver a clean election.

Reuters reported few signs of organized violence or intimidation at the polls, although the voting in one precinct had to be halted due to the unexpected death of the candidate, a BNP leader was killed in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal down of Khulna, and a homemade bomb injured several people outside a polling station in Gopalganj, Sheikh Hasina’s political stronghold.

No matter who wins the election, India is likely to be a loser, as it enjoyed very close ties with Hasina and the Awami League. China and Pakistan are looking forward to greater influence in the post-Hasina government and China’s ambassador Yao Wen is already holding meetings with high-level Bangladeshi officials to discuss new billion-dollar infrastructure projects.

Text: Australia vs Zimbabwe T20 World Cup 2026 Live Cricket Score Updates: Australia, still without Mitch Marsh, opted to bowl against Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup 2026 Group B match at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday with both sides looking to join Sri Lanka at the top of the table. A victory would take either of these two sides to four points in two games. Both Australia and Zimbabwe were clinical in their wins in their respective tournament openers. While Australia thrashed Ireland by 67 runs, Zimbabwe were a notch up to a listless Oman as they won the contest by eight wickets.

The biggest concern for Australia will be the fitness of their skipper, Mitchell Marsh, who was ruled out of the Ireland game moments before the toss after copping a blow to his groin last week that reportedly caused internal testicular bleeding. It was an unusual instance as Australia took the field against Ireland with just 12 fit available players. In Marsh’s absence, Travis Head captained the team with Josh Inglis moving up the order to partner the left-hander.

Burl on the charge, better intent from the left-hander, a reverse hit off Kunhemann for a four. But a decent over from the left-arm spinner otherwise, a 7-run over is not bad.

The shackles are loosened somewhat. Burl has been biding his time but the left-hander goes after one of Australia's prime threats in Nathan Ellis. An attempted slower bouncer is pulled away and then a fuller ball is smacked down the ground for a couple of fours in that over.

Kunhemann returns to the attack and it is a steady 8-run over, a couple of doubles thrown in the midst of singles. Bennett and Burl living up to the name of consolidate phase of the innings.

Travis Head and Josh Inglis will be having a word with each other after this innings presumably. That is ANOTHER SHOCKING REVIEW for a caught behind. The noise didn't sound woody even on broadcast, clearly seemed to be coming off the thigh pad and the replays confirm it immediately. Two reviews wasted for similar appeals. Odd end to an otherwise tidy over from Green.

Marumani was doing the heavylifting in the powerplay so Zimbabwe are losing some momentum here after his departure. Burl is the new batter in, and he can pull out the big hits. But Zimbabwe are consolidating in this little period. Six-run over from Zampa.

Green comes into the attack.

And Australia have a breakthrough. Stoinis comes back into the attack and breaks the opening partnership. A cross-seam delivery cramps Marumani on the angle, there is not enough width to cut it, so he mishits and is caught behind.

Tadiwanashe Marumani c Josh Inglis b Marcus Stoinis 35 (21 balls)

Adam Zampa, Australia's Trump card in these conditions, is hit for a boundary each by Marumani and Bennett. Zimbabwe are playing some solid cricket and taking the attack to the Aussies. A 10-run over just after the powerplay.

A solid powerplay, or the launch phase as it has been renamed for this World Cup, as Zimbabwe finish without losing a wicket and nearly getting to 50. A four for Bennett as Ellis comes on to bowl his first over. There is not much help on the pitch for the bowlers here clearly, but Zimbabwe have done well to put some pressure back on the favourites.

END OF POWERPLAY. DRINKS. ZIM 47/0.

Now Bennett joins the party. Kuhnemann welcomed into the attack with a four over mid on. Three dot balls follow and then Bennett takes him on again, against the spin. Nails a sweep that almost carries all the way, flat. Both the ZIM openers have actually taken on bowlers against their regular matchups. This is now a really good start for the African side.

Marumani on the charge here! Maxwell comes into bowl and the left-hander takes on the spinner with some style. Starts the over with a reverse-hit for four, repeats it later in the over. And then throws in a conventional sweep as well for good measure. Three fours in that over.

Marumani hits the first of the match. One ball after going for a pull to one that was outside off, he adjusts his radar quickly and cuts a similar ball in front of point for a four. Follows that up with a hoick through the square leg region, ugly but effective. Bennett tries a couple of fancy shots later in the over but tied down by dots.

Stoinis shares the new ball with Dwarshius and starts off with a delivery that shapes back into the left-handed Marumani but goes wide. Tests the lefty with a bouncer later and the mishit pull shot falls short of Ellis in the deep. A very tidy over from Stoinis too.

Australia burn a review in the first over. Inglis is convinced Bennett has got some bat or glove on this, to a short ball on the hips down the leg side. But the ball is nowhere near either. A wasted review early on. A tidy over from Dwarshius though, just a couple of doubles, ends with a ripper that cuts Bennett in half.

Ben Dwarshius to start things off with his left-arm pace. Bennett and Marumani in the middle for Zimbabwe.

National anthems done and we are good to go.

Sikandar Raza at the toss: "We don't get a lot of bilateral against them, so suddenly ICC has given us this dance floor and all I'm asking for is that we should take full advantage of them, try and put our best foot forward and give them a really good game as well and see what happens after that. We've got two changes unfortunately. Brendan Taylor picked up an injury and he's been ruled out of the competition. On the other hand, Richard Ngarava is more of a precautionary measure. His first scan and second scan has come back pretty positive. So he misses out today as well. And for those, Tony Munyonga and Greame Creamer are in."

Blessing Muzarabani (96) is four away from becoming the third player to record 100 wickets for Zimbabwe in men’s T20Is (Richard Ngarava – 111, Sikandar Raza – 103); he’s taken at least two wickets in each of his last two innings in the format.

Australia haven't had too many options to pick from... but they have still made two changes with Cooper Connolly and Xavier Bartlett sitting out. Ben Dwarshius and Tim David, who was fighting to get fit for the backend of the tournament, are back into the XI.

Zimbabwe XI: Brian Bennett, Tadiwanashe Marumani (wk), Dion Myers, Sikandar Raza (c), Ryan Burl, Tony Munyonga, Tashinga Musekiwa, Brad Evans, Wellington Masakadza, Graeme Cremer, Blessing Muzarabani

Australia XI: Travis Head( c), Josh Inglis (wk), Cameron Green, Matt Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Matthew Kuhnemann

Australia win the toss, Travis Head is the captain once more... and he opts to bowl first.

Nathan Ellis will be key for Australia.

He has taken 17 wickets at a strike rate of 10.5 across his last eight T20 bowling innings (x7 Big Bash League, x1 T20I), recording at least one wicket in each of those eight innings; he logged figures of 4-12 against Ireland last time out (11 February 2026), becoming the sixth player to take 4+ wickets in an innings for Australia in ICC Men’s T20 World Cup history.

via Opta / ICC

Australia will be aiming for consecutive wins in men’s T20Is in Asia for the first time since June 2022, following their 67-run victory against Ireland last time out (11 February 2026) which snapped a five-match losing run on the continent in the format – they had lost to Pakistan before the tournament. On the other side, Zimbabwe have scored at least 60% of their runs from boundaries in each of their last three men’s T20I innings; they hadn’t done so in any of their six innings in the format prior to that span.

via Opta / ICC

Australia defeated Ireland by 67 runs in their opening game of this ICC Men’s T20 World Cup (11 February 2026); they will be aiming for consecutive wins to begin the tournament for the fifth time (2010, 2012, 2021, 2024). Meanwhile, Zimbabwe defeated Oman by eight wickets in their opening game of this ICC Men’s T20 World Cup (9 February 2026); the last time they won back-to-back games in the competition was in October 2022 (a streak of two games).

Via Opta / ICC

The exact nature of his injury is yet to be determined but veteran Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Brendan Taylor will almost certainly not be playing in today's match. He had retired hurt against Oman and captain Sikandar Raza had said at the time that he was pretty clear about not allowing Taylor on to the field unless he is convinced that the latter is okay.

Now Mitch Marsh's injury may have been a blow for Australia but that was followed by news that sent a few headlines around the cricket world. Former captain Steve Smith was finally called up, having been left out despite sending the scoreboards flapping in the BBL just before this tournament. However, he only flew out yesterday night and is yet to be officially added to the squad. And so the jury is still out on whether we will see him take the field today.

The fast bowler was the player of the match in Zimbabwe's big win over Oman in that opening match. He is now four wickets away from becoming the third Zimbabwean to take 100 wickets in T20I cricket.

Both sides will have to deal with some pretty humid conditions today and moreover, there is rain forecast for later in the afternoon. However, it is unlikely that this will have any impact on the game. Unless, of course, it goes into one or more rounds of Super Overs.

Both teams were hardly challenged really in their opening games of this year's tournament. Australia thrashed Ireland by 67 runs. Zimbabwe blew away a listless Oman as they won the contest by eight wickets

Brian Bennett, Tadiwanashe Marumani, Dion Myers, Brendan Taylor(w), Sikandar Raza(c), Ryan Burl, Tashinga Musekiwa, Brad Evans, Wellington Masakadza, Richard Ngarava, Blessing Muzarabani, Tony Munyonga, Clive Madande, Tinotenda Maposa, Graeme Cremer.

Australia: Travis Head(c), Josh Inglis(w), Cameron Green, Matt Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Cooper Connolly, Xavier Bartlett, Nathan Ellis, Matthew Kuhnemann, Adam Zampa, Ben Dwarshuis, Tim David, Mitchell Marsh.

Australia are up against Zimbabwe in the first match of the day today at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. Both sides were clinical in their respective tournament openers but Australia are the obvious favourites. Can Zimbabwe stage a famous upset? Stay tuned for more updates!

A court in Assam’s Guwahati on Wednesday restrained three Congress leaders, including the head of the party’s state unit Gaurav Gogoi, from making “defamatory statements” about Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, PTI reported.

Civil Judge Nayanjyoti Sarma ordered an interim injunction on Gogoi, Jitendra Singh and Bhupesh Baghel from “making, publishing, circulating or disseminating any further defamatory statements or materials” about the Bharatiya Janata Party leader until they appear before the court.

The judge held that not passing such an order would “defeat the justice” and may lead to multiple proceedings.

The court directed the Congress leaders to appear before it on March 9, PTI reported.

The chief minister’s counsel said that the defendants have been issued notices by the court to furnish proof of their allegations, The Assam Tribune reported.

On Tuesday, Himanta Biswa Sarma filed a defamation suit against the three leaders, claiming that they had made malicious allegations against him.

Sarma said on social media that he had sought Rs 500 crore in damages, but did not specify the allegations he was referring to.

The case came following a press conference on February 4 in which the Congress launched a campaign against the chief minister, alleging that around “12,000 bighas of land have been grabbed in the name of his family members in different parts of the state in violation of rules”.

Gogoi had said that the party was investigating and tracing the sources of the chief minister’s assets.

Hours after that press conference, Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he would initiate contempt proceedings against the three politicians and Congress’ Legislative Party leader Debabrata Saikia.


The defamation complaint came the same day the Congress’ Assam unit filed a police complaint against the BJP for sharing a video depicting Sarma symbolically firing at images of two Muslim men at point-blank range.


The clip combined what appeared to be original footage of the BJP leader handling rifles with artificial intelligence-generated images portraying Muslims as targets. On-screen text included slogans such as “Foreigner free Assam”, “No mercy”, “Why did you not go to Pakistan?” and “There is no forgiveness to Bangladeshis”.

The BJP’s Assam unit has claimed that the post was unauthorised. One of the four co-convenors of the party’s state social media cell has been removed from his position in connection with the video, The Indian Express reported on Wednesday.

Assembly elections are expected to be held in the state between March and May.

Text: Sixteen years after the German Bakery bomb blast in Pune, the trial against alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) terror operative Mohammed Ahmed Zarar Siddibappa alias Yasin Bhatkal (43), one of the key accused in this case, is still on before a special court in Pune.

A high intensity bomb blast at the German Bakery in Koregaon Park area of Pune city, left 17 persons dead and 56 others injured, on the evening of February 13, 2010. In his confession recorded before a court in Kukatpally (in Telangana) in October 2013, Yasin mentioned his role in the German Bakery blast.

As per the confession statement, Yasin hails from Bhatkal in Karnataka. His father, while doing garments and shoes business in Dubai, visited Bhatkal once in three months.

It is stated that Yasin, religious since childhood, failed in SSCL (Class 10 board exams). Initially, he started a business of “garments (Lungi)” in Mumbai in 2001, but within four months, shifted to Bhatkal, where he sold perfumes for about three years.

Some college students like Fasih Mahmood (who later allegedly became an IM operative) often visited Yasin’s perfume shop. Lectures and discussions on jihad and communal violence, were held at the shop, police said.

Between 2004 and 2006, Yasin went to Dubai for a “job in construction” and a business in sports goods. As per Yasin’s confession, around 2004, he met IM founders Riyaz Bhatkal and Iqbal Bhatkal in Mumbai. Yasin did “Jadi Bhooti” business with Bhatkal brothers. Yasin stated how he once admonished Iqbal for buying a motorcycle on a bank loan, as it was against Islam.

As per Riyaz’s instructions, Yasin went to Pakistan in December 2005 for a training of about 50 days in firearms and explosives like TNT (Trinitrotoluene) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Then he went to Dubai, where he started a “personality training educational institute”, it is stated.

Investigators believe that IM was founded around this period. About his association with IM, Yasin stated that he joined an “Usaba”, headed by Iqbal Bhatkal. “Usaba means a group of men who are more than 11 and less than 40… the said Usaba (congregation) is an Arabic word and established in 2005. The main object of Usaba is to collect the persons having the same mentality and dedication to do something.” he stated.

Yasin returned to India from Dubai in 2007. He stayed at a farmhouse in Koppa in Karnataka for a year, when Riyaz asked him to experiment with a “bomb”.

In his confession, Yasin stated how during March 2008, he prepared “Claymore IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) getting inspired by a Hollywood movie. Yasin also stated how the IM members took a house on rent in Pune, kept changing their locations, while IEDs prepared by him were used for various terror attacks in the country, before his arrest from the India- Nepal border in Bihar, on August 28, 2013

Previously, the Kolkata police had arrested Yasin in December 2009 in an arms dealing case. Yasin stated that after coming out of jail, he along with Qateel Siddiqui and others wanted to take revenge. “Accordingly we blasted German Bakery, Pune on 31.2.2010,” he stated.

The Maharashtra ATS arrested Yasin in German Bakery case on March 14, 2014 and filed a chargesheet against him in August same year. Investigators believe that Yasin is visible in the CCTV footage of the blast day obtained from the German bakery premises during the probe. The trial against Yasin is on before a special court in Pune court.

A special NIA court awarded death sentence to Yasin, along with IM member Ajaz Shaikh, a BPO staffer from Pune, for Hyderabad twin blasts on February 21, 2013. The court order stated that Ajaz had allegedly delivered the explosives for bombing the German Bakery to Yasin. But the ATS probe made no mention of Ajaz.

A Delhi police probe into the arrest of alleged IM operative Qateel Siddiqui in November 2011, revealed he conducted a recce of the German Bakery along with Yasin. The ATS had later arrested Siddiqui for his alleged plan to bomb the Dagdusheth Ganpati temple on February 13, 2010, same day when German Bakery was attacked. However, Siddqui was murdered by Pune gangster Sharad Mohol at the Yerwada jail in June 2012. Mohol was shot dead by a gang member in January 2024.

The ATS probe

The ATS had filed a charge sheet against seven persons – Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Bhatkal, Yasin Bhatkal, Mohsin Choudhari of IM and alleged Lashkar E Taiba (LeT) operatives Himayat Baig. Fayyaz Kagzi, Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jundal of Beed district, in German Bakery case.

On April 18, 2013, a Pune court granted death penalty to Baig, who was arrested by the ATS in September 2010. In May 2016, the Bombay High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. But, Yasin’s confession says nothing about Baig.

Jundal, alleged to be involved in 26/11 Mumbai attack, was deported from Saudi Arabia to India on June 25, 2012. He has not yet been arrested in the German Bakery case. Riyaz, Iqbal and Mohsin, a Pune resident, are absconding. Fayyaz Kagzi is known to have blown himself up outside the US consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on July 4, 2016.

Text: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been in jail since 2023, is reportedly left with 15% vision in his right eye after prison authorities allegedly failed to take action, his lawyer has informed the country’s Supreme Court.

According to a BBC report, Khan’s lawyer Salman Safdar, who was allowed by the authorities to meet his client this week in prison, said that the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) began experiencing hazy and blurry vision around three to four months ago.

The lawyer said that the jail superintendent was informed about Khan’s condition, but despite sharing the information, no action was taken by the jail authorities beyond giving him eye drops.

The Pakistan administration had earlier confirmed that Khan underwent a 20-minute medical procedure on January 24 at the PIMS hospital in Islamabad. At the time, Pakistan government’s minister Ata Tarar had said that Khan was “fine and healthy.”

Khan’s lawyer Safdar was the first outside visitor to see the former prime minister in seven weeks and he said that his client’s condition was diagnosed as a blood clot in his right eye which has allegedly caused severe damage and left him with limited vision, BBC reported.

Safdar submitted a report, detailing Khan’s medical condition, to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hasan.

The former prime minister’s lawyer called for an expert ophthalmologist to review the condition of Khan’s eyes and the PTI leader be allowed to meet his family and have better conditions in jail.

“Khan had been left visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention,” Safdar said.

Imran khan has been behind the bars since August 2023 and is facing charges in over 100 cases, including selling state gifts, leaking state secrets among others.

A report by the U.N. Security Council sanctions monitoring team has noted that Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed was reported to be linked to a terror attack on the Red Fort in New Delhi last November that killed 15 people.

“One Member State noted that Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for a series of attacks. It was also reported to be linked to an attack on the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 9 that killed 15 people,” the 37th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team submitted to the Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee concerning ISIL and al-Qaeda said.

The report, issued in United Nations, added that on October 8, JeM leader Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi “formally announced the establishment of a women-only wing, Jamaat ul-Muminat, which was aimed at supporting terrorist attacks.”

Even as another member state reported that Jaish-e-Mohammed was defunct, the report added that “Separately, it was reported that on July 28, three individuals allegedly involved in the attack perpetrated in Pahalgam, in Jammu and Kashmir, were killed.”

A deadly and high-intensity explosion had rocked the Red Fort area in New Delhi, killing about 15 people and injuring many more. The explosion had ripped through a slow-moving car at a traffic signal near the Red Fort metro station.

At his weekly briefing in New Delhi on Thursday (February 12), Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal was asked for a comment on the UNSC report.

"This particular report that you refer to, it is available in the public domain. It is online. This was the 37th Report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team. This was published on February 4, 2026," he said.

"And, we have seen that they have taken on board our inputs, India's inputs in regard to our concern on cross-border terrorism, and also as to how we can strengthen the global fight against terrorism," the MEA spokesperson said.

The UNSC report further said that Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) remained active in south-eastern Afghanistan, where the Haqqani Network exerts considerable influence. Osama Mahmoud, the “emir” of AQIS, and Yahya Ghauri, his deputy, were reported to be in Kabul, with the media cell of AQIS based in Herat.

“There were concerns that AQIS was increasingly focused on external operations. Such operations would likely be unclaimed or deniable operations, perhaps as part of the umbrella group Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan…so as not to create difficulties for the Taliban as hosts of AQIS,” it said.

The report added that ISIL-K was active mainly in northern Afghanistan, particularly Badakhshan, and areas close to the Pakistani border. It continued to develop its network of cells to project a threat regionally and beyond.

“Aggressive propaganda by ISIL-K in Central Asian languages expanded its target audience. It sought to exploit issues such as the Gaza and Israel conflict to promote recruitment and financing,” it added.

The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by Tarique Rahman, secured an emphatic victory in the Bangladesh elections, with a resounding mandate in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the South Asian nation. Leading in over 200 seats in the 300-seat parliament, the party will now form the government with a two-thirds majority, while Jamaat-e-Islami will emerge as the main Opposition party in Bangladesh. This is a remarkable turnaround for a party that had long been a political pariah. These are the first national elections since the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Follow here for the latest updates on the Bangladesh Election Results 2026.


🚨 Big Story

Soon after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey submitted a notice moving a substantive motion against the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, the latter once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over India-US the trade deal, asserting, “do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers” and “will not budge even an inch”. Gandhi’s remarks came a day after he mounted a sharp attack on the government, accusing it of compromising India’s energy security and farm interests in the trade deal. On Thursday, Dubey sought Gandhi’s “immediate expulsion” from the Lower House after initiating an “inquiry to examine all his unethical conduct”.

Then, is the LoP at the risk of being expelled? With the substantive motion moved against Gandhi, all eyes are on what this crucial instrument means. According to M N Kaul’s and S L Shakdher’s authoritative book Practice and Procedure of Parliament, “a substantive motion is a self-contained independent proposal submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a manner as to be capable of expressing a decision of the House.” They are put to a vote so that they express the decision of the House. Here’s what substantive motions mean.

Fallout: Following Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri’s statement that he had met convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “three or four times”, Congress MP and party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Thursday demanded the resignation of the Cabinet Minister. Priyanka alleged that Puri had corresponded with Epstein after the allegations against him were made public. The fresh tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) on January 30 shows that Puri exchanged emails with Epstein in 2014-15. Referring to the documents, Priyanka told The Indian Express, “In my opinion, he should resign.”

“While we are opponents, we are not enemies”.

As the Parliament Budget Session 2026 is underway, our columnist Neerja Chowdhury reflects on the declining parliamentary standards in the country, which has now become “commonplace,” and suggests all MPs should remember BJP leader Sushma Swaraj’s words in 2014, during the last sitting of the 15th Lok Sabha.

In the backdrop of the recent disruptions in the Parliament that have rendered sessions dysfunctional, Chowdhury writes: “The bitterness that has come to vitiate the relationship between the two sides makes dialogue that much more difficult. While the government has to ensure Parliament runs smoothly, it is not possible without the cooperation of the Opposition, or without civility in public discourse, which is becoming a casualty.” Here’s why MPs need to recall Swaraj’s words once again.

📰 From the Front Page

Following a dip in membership and revenue, the legal fraternity, comprising 15 Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court, has now stepped in to save ‘Mohammad’ Deepak’s gym in Kotdwar. Deepak was thrust into the limelight in January when he stood up to a group of men who were harassing a 70-year-old Muslim shopkeeper, suffering from Parkinson’s disease, to drop the word “Baba” from his shop’s name. A video of Deepak calling himself Mohammad Deepak during the confrontation went viral, and he soon began to struggle to sustain his livelihood. The Senior Advocates have pitched in Rs 10,000 each as a one-year membership fee. The move, they said, was inspired by the act of CPI(M) MP John Brittas, who had visited the gym and purchased the membership.

The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) Thursday cleared the long-awaited proposal to buy 114 Rafale fighter jets from France under an inter-governmental deal for the Indian Air Force (IAF), of which 90 jets would be manufactured in India. Led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the DAC has also cleared the procurement of six additional P8I maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft from the US for the Navy. The development comes days before French President Emmanuel Macron’s scheduled visit to India between February 17 and 19.

📌 Must Read

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri Thursday held a meeting with United States Ambassador Sergio Gor in New Delhi, following which the latter confirmed that with the finalisation of the trade deal, many opportunities are poised to open up for partnership between the two countries. This comes on a day when New Delhi has categorically said that the joint statement released by both sides on February 7 remains the basis for the interim trade agreement.

In our Opinion section today, N K Singh takes a deep dive into India’s next steps as the world adjusts to the United States power politics. Singh writes: “A successful negotiation is often said to leave all sides equally dissatisfied. If this agreement raises exports and deepens technical-industrial capability during a disorderly global transition, it is a substantial achievement. It is ironic that a momentous mindset shift is met with prevarication. India is mature enough to seek purposeful engagement with a credible place in the global value added chain. What could have been a moment missed has become a moment seized.”

AI Stack: The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in India largely depends on how our AI applications can help improve the quality of life of our citizens. The Economic Survey 2026 is pragmatic about how India can leverage AI and solve its social and economic problems. Applications in health, agriculture, education, urban management, and disaster preparedness seem to show some promise. Certainly, with the right support, many of these can scale to a pan-India market and, later, can be bundled into an India AI Applications Stack. Take a look at some groundbreaking initiatives.

⏳ And Finally…

The whole of Pakistan is counting on Sahibzada Farhan against India, as both countries gear up to fight it out on Sunday at the Sri Lanka ground. For, Farhan has done what few other batsmen in the world have – to counterpunch Jasprit Bumrah and unsettle him in the first spell. My colleague Venkata Krishna B, who’s in Sri Lanka covering the ICC T20 World Cup, writes: “From 2019 to 2024, Pakistan has witnessed their batsmen crumble against Bumrah. Be it Ahmedabad or New York, Bumrah has cracked open the game with his artistry similar to how Pakistan’s wondrous seamers had subjected Indian batsmen during their good old days. Hence, Farhan’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed.”

🎧 Lastly, don’t forget to tune in to today’s episode of our 3 Things podcast, where we discuss the chaos over an AI-generated video of Himanta that left BJP red-faced; BJD protests in Odisha; as well as India’s latest procurement of 114 Rafale jets, Poseidon 8I maritime surveillance along with anti-submarine warfare aircraft.

That’s all for today. Have a wonderful day!

Until next time,
Ariba

Updated  - February 13, 2026 10:59 am IST


Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally acknowledged the new world order. The hard part is to formulate a new national identity and approach to international relations.

India’s leadership of the Global South at the United Nations General Assembly was the foundation of its long-standing foreign policy of ‘strategic autonomy’. The global rules agreed in the UN established by former colonial powers led by the U.S. served their interests in the post-colonial world. India’s Oxbridge-educated diplomats had unquestioned leadership in the UN negotiating text on principles and rules, successfully diverting pressure on poor countries. Climate negotiations ending in 1992 were left entirely to India by the Global South.

However, China’s rise around 2010, through the creation of alternative funding, economic and security institutions, impacted the intellectual leadership position of India and also changed the UN irreversibly. China heads four principal UN agencies, and its aid volumes exceed those of the West. The U.S., now unable to manage the UN process, has withdrawn from 31 UN institutions.

In 1986, the U.S. launched the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, leading to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, where developing countries’ interests became more differentiated, and India struggled to secure its interests. In a more equal world, since 2019, the U.S. has rejected the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO, making it dysfunctional and reverting to unilateral tariffs. China, in contrast, has diversified its exports away from the U.S. and is now the largest trading partner of 120 countries.

The problem India faces is not from the rise of China. While the EU and Canada acknowledge the collapse of the multilateral structures, developing countries are wondering how to revive them. With the potential to become the world’s third-largest economy, India is particularly impacted in the U.S.-dominated world of transactional relationships, even willing to discard NATO.

First, leadership of the Global South gave India outsized influence and now where do you speak for developing countries when international institutions and law have withered away? The U.S. and China are competing for technological dominance, not votes in the UN.

Second, ‘strategic autonomy’ applied to the Cold War when India led the Non-Aligned Movement. It lost relevance after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and gradually became a self-declared identity used to rationalise foreign policy choices. India joined the U.S.-led rejuvenated Quad in 2017 and then chose the Russian S-400 missile system over the U.S. Patriot system in 2018.

The reality is that India gravitated towards the Soviet Union after its 1951 veto prevented discussion of Kashmir in the UN Security Council. Russia remains India’s only long-trusted partner giving cutting-edge military technology, which the U.S. is chipping away at testing India’s resolve to remain a third pole in a multipolar world.

Third, with China’s rise, U.S. analysts began describing India not as strategically autonomous but as a “swing state.” The current U.S. military strategy rejects containment of China.

The major scope of international relations, outside of alliances, was within multilateral institutions which has now returned to asymmetric relations. Reciprocity in tariffs is redefined as “America first”, implying others are in a subordinate relationship. Under the India-U.S. Framework Agreement, India has agreed to double imports, largely industrial products, while the U.S. continues an 18% tariff, unilaterally deciding reductions clearly after further concessions. The EU trade agreement eliminated 70% tariff lines with phased reciprocal reductions.

The real question for India is why it was targeted by the U.S. tariffs and how to grow in a world marked by flux.

The U.S. is determined to prevent the rise of another China and India alone has the potential to overtake the U.S. China exploited multilateral rules to become a fiercely independent global manufacturing power and that opportunity no longer exists. The long-term U.S. policy of keeping India apart from Russia and China has now gained greater force and blunting it will test Indian diplomacy.

India’s comparative advantage lies in its young population; nearly half of Silicon Valley’s workforce traces its roots to India. Building and attracting that talent can develop the capability to become a ‘cyber superpower’, spreading AI across security, manufacturing and services to secure development space.

To achieve this, India needs good economic and technological relations with the U.S., Russia, and China, Free Trade Agreements (FTA), and, importantly foreign policy replacing ‘strategic autonomy’ with ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’.

First, taking a leaf from China and the U.S. in the early 1900s, India should bide its time, maintain a low international profile and develop endogenous capabilities, requiring a diplomatic posture to accelerate the Asian Century and a passive role in all other regions.

Second, India must prioritise trade diplomacy by diversifying exports away from the U.S., even as vulnerabilities remain in bilateral relationships. Now that India is open to industrial imports, the push for FTAs must continue with Asia, soon to have two-thirds of global wealth, and Africa, the fastest-growing continent.

Third, India should create new technological, cyber and space relations with Russia, its steadfast and tested partner, now more an Asian than European power. It should also enable China to invest in infrastructure and partner manufacturing, with safeguards, to take advantage of trade opportunities and accelerate growth.

Fourth, India should treat relations with Pakistan as a foreign policy issue rather than a security challenge. A new water-sharing arrangement incorporating the needs of the Kashmir Valley, revival of the Iran-Pakistan-India Peace Pipeline with Pakistan benefiting from transit fees, and even a trade agreement could create economic incentives.

Lastly, as chair of BRICS, India has an opportunity to articulate its new foreign policy by building consensus on repositioning BRICS as an economic cooperation community, not a political multilateral body. Linking official digital currencies to make cross-border trade, repatriation and tourism payments smoother will be a good first step.

Text: Bangladesh election results 2026: Tarique Rahman-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming two-thirds majority Friday in general elections, a result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in 2024.

Tarique Rahman, who is the son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, won the two seats — Dhaka 17 and Bogra 6 — which he contested. Rahman is the frontrunner for the PM’s post. Indian PM Narendra Modi and Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif have congratulated Rahman on BNP’s historic win.

Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said. The opposition Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.

The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.

Rahman has spent nearly two decades outside the country, navigating exile, court convictions, and political survival — even as he retained firm control over the BNP’s organisational machinery from afar.

Tarique Rahman is the eldest son of Ziaur Rahman, Bangladesh’s former military ruler-turned-president, and Khaleda Zia, the country’s first woman prime minister and a two-time head of government.

This lineage placed him at the heart of Bangladesh’s bitter two-party rivalry early on — between the BNP and Awami League, but also ensured that his political rise would be closely scrutinised, both within and outside his party.

2. Rise within the BNP

Rahman rose rapidly within the BNP during his mother’s second term as Prime Minister (2001–06), emerging as a key organisational strategist and power broker. Though he did not hold a formal government office during this period, he was widely viewed as one of the most influential figures within the party.

Over time, he consolidated his position, eventually becoming the BNP’s acting chairman, exercising effective control over party affairs even while living abroad.

3. Self-imposed exile in London

Following the Awami League’s landslide victory in the 2008 general election, Rahman left Bangladesh and settled in London, citing concerns over personal security and what the BNP described as state-sponsored political persecution.

Since then, he has remained outside the country, directing party strategy from exile, a rare arrangement in South Asian politics that has drawn both criticism and grudging acknowledgement of his grip over the BNP.

4. Legal cases and political contestation

During the years of Awami League rule under Sheikh Hasina, Rahman faced multiple criminal cases, including charges related to corruption, money laundering, illegal acquisition of wealth, and involvement in a 2004 grenade attack.

Bangladeshi courts convicted him in some of these cases in absentia. The BNP has consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated and aimed at neutralising its leadership. Supporters see him as a victim of selective prosecution; critics view the convictions as evidence of entrenched corruption during BNP rule.

The legal record surrounding Rahman remains one of the most polarising aspects of his public image.

5. A leader without a Parliamentary seat

Despite being the BNP’s principal leader, Rahman has never served as a member of the Jatiya Sangsad, Bangladesh’s Parliament. His authority has stemmed not from electoral office but from party control, lineage, and organisational command.

This unusual position — a national leader without legislative experience, has shaped both expectations and scepticism around his future role, should he return to active politics within Bangladesh.

To supporters, Tarique Rahman represents the unfinished legacy of Ziaur Rahman and the possibility of restoring what they describe as competitive politics in Bangladesh. To critics, he symbolises dynastic entitlement and the unresolved questions of accountability that have long haunted the BNP.

Either way, as Bangladesh enters a new and uncertain phase, Rahman remains a central and unavoidable figure in the country’s political imagination.

Text: Half-centuries from Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya and a spin-bowling masterclass from Varun Chakaravarthy helped India thrash Namibia by 93 runs in the T20 World Cup 2026 Group A match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday.

Chasing a stiff 210 target, Namibia got off to a brisk start but a lethal bowling attack from India bundled out the visitors on 116 in 18.2 overs as India continued their winning run in this World Cup.

Earlier, Kishan and Pandya shone with the bat as India managed 209/9 in 20 overs after being asked to bat.

If Sanju Samson’s three-sixes innings was akin to a short-lived Instagram reel, Kishan’s batting was a gripping web series, full of drama, action and anticipation.

Kishan smashed the daylights out of a club class Namibia attack to score a 24-ball-61 but Indian batters struggled against Gerhard Erasmus’ side-arm off-breaks before posting 209 for 9 in a group league fixture of the T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

Kishan muscled five sixes and half a dozen boundaries for a 20-ball-50 that set the foundation for a marauding Hardik Pandya (52 off 28 balls) to take the team to a total that looked beyond the reach of this Namibian batting line-up.

AS IT HAPPENED | INDIA VS NAMIBIA T20 WORLD CUP 2026 HIGHLIGHTS

However, Namibia skipper Erasmus (4/20 in 4 overs) gave a fantastic account of himself and would certainly keep Pakistan’s lethal weapon Usman Tariq interested come Sunday.

Erasmus bowled side-arm deliveries in between the stock ball which is round arm. As a variation, he also bowled from behind the crease to shorten the length, as a set Tilak Varma (25) couldn’t reach to the pitch of the delivery.

It was a flat Kotla deck but Sanju Samson (22 off 8 balls) and skipper Suryakumar Yadav, with a run-a-ball 12, missed out on scoring big with the African side making some sort of a comeback with the ball during the middle overs.

Surya certainly got the best delivery of the innings from left arm spinner Bernard Scholtz, who got one to dip and turn as the skipper gave the charge, missed and was duly stumped.

It was a golden opportunity for Samson to make it count. The three sixes — one down the ground and the other two a product of sinewy wrists — sent the capacity crowd into raptures. But another cute flick didn’t have the wings to clear the fielder at the cow corner.

Samson’s knock was full of intent but fell short in effectiveness quotient.

The difference between Kishan and Samson over the past one month has been consistency and understanding the value of a God-send second chance.

The Namibian pacers didn’t stand any chance against him and the moment they erred in length, Ishan’s willow came down like a sledgehammer at a tremendous bat speed and the sixes soared into the stands.

During the back-10, India’s MVP Pandya took charge as his four sixes and four boundaries kept the momentum going, with Shivam Dube (23 off 16 balls) giving him good support in a 81 run stand off just 6.3 overs.

Text: Tarique Rahman, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and son of former Prime Minister the late Khaleda Zia, is poised to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister.

In his maiden speech after his return to the country after 17 years of self-imposed exile in England, Rahman recalled the famous “I Have a Dream” speech of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King. However, he remarked that while MLK had a dream, he himself had a plan to build a nation that is safe and inclusive for all citizens, irrespective of faith and region. The moment has now arrived to test whether that plan can translate into reality.

On the domestic front, Bangladesh today faces deep polarisation along political, cultural, and religious lines. The new regime must, therefore, undertake bold and innovative interventions during the initial “honeymoon period” of governance. Despite his electoral success, Rahman is nowhere close to the mass popularity once enjoyed by Bangladesh’s founding Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who faced his first public protest in September 1972, merely eight months into office. Public expectations today are no less demanding than those at the birth of the nation.

Beyond the familiar challenges of corruption, unemployment, and law and order, the most pressing issue confronting Tarique Rahman’s government is how to deal with Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League. There is an uncomfortable truth in Hasina’s recent assertion that “a government born of exclusion cannot unite a divided nation.” Although the 2026 elections may be the most credible since 2009, their legitimacy would have been far stronger had the Awami League participated.

Tarique Rahman now faces a critical choice: Pursue a path of political vengeance, as has often been the case in Pakistan, or adopt a reconciliatory approach inspired by South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation initiatives. The latter could involve granting Sheikh Hasina a pardon, allowing her return to Dhaka, but barring her and her family from future political participation while reintegrating the Awami League into the democratic process.

One of the major structural obstacles to democracy in Bangladesh, as in much of South Asia, is dynastic politics. Denying future political roles to Hasina’s family would mark a significant step toward de-dynastification. However, such reform would require Rahman to initiate similar internal reforms within the BNP. Without dismantling dynastic dominance, Bangladesh’s democracy will remain half-baked.

On the geopolitical front, the harsh reality is that most nation-states today are compelled to navigate great power rivalries, often at a heavy cost. Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iran offer stark examples. Bangladesh is no exception. Rahman’s challenge will be balancing relations with key regional and global actors, particularly India, China, Pakistan, and the United States. During his tenure, Yunus signaled a shift toward closer ties with China and Pakistan, a move that’s not gone down well with India. Meanwhile, in her first interview after arriving in Delhi, Sheikh Hasina alleged American involvement in her exit, though her own governance failures were significant.

For Rahman, repairing Indo-Bangladesh relations must be a top priority, perhaps even drawing lessons from aspects of Hasina’s earlier diplomacy. Two issues will be decisive: The treatment of religious minorities, particularly Hindus, and Bangladesh’s posture toward militant groups operating in India’s Northeast. Never has it been clearer that minority rights across South Asia are deeply interconnected. The entire South Asian leadership needs to reflect on how to address the issue in a long-term fashion. Under Yunus, Dhaka not only failed to curb violence against Hindus but at times appeared complicit, despite his conciliatory rhetoric.

The only durable guarantee for minority safety lies in restoring Bangladesh’s secular constitutional ethos — an ambition that appears increasingly difficult given the growing influence of Jamaat-e-Islami. Yet without this foundational shift, any democratic transformation in Bangladesh will remain elusive.

Text: Bangladesh is holding its first election since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government collapsed in 2024 following mass protests

DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Voters cast ballots across Bangladesh on Thursday in a parliamentary election seen as a critical test of the country’s democracy after years of political turmoil.

After a slow start, crowds came to polling stations in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere by midmorning. Balloting will continue through Thursday with results expected Friday.

More than 127 million people are eligible to vote in Bangladesh’s first election since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government collapsed in 2024 after weeks of mass protests, dubbed by many as a Gen Z uprising. Hasina fled the country and her party is banned from the polls. She is living in exile in India.

Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party is a leading contender to form the next government. He is the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in self-exile in London. Rahman has pledged to rebuild democratic institutions, restore the rule of law and revive the struggling economy.

Challenging the BNP is an 11-party alliance led by the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist party, which was banned under Hasina but has gained prominence since her removal. The conservative religious group’s growing influence has fueled concern, particularly among women and minority communities, that social freedoms could come under pressure if they come to power. Bangladesh is more than 90% Muslim, while around 8% are Hindu.

Shafiqur Rahman, chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, expressed optimism after casting his vote in a polling station.

“It (the election) is a turning point,” he told The Associated Press. “People demand change. They desire change. We also desire the change.”

The vote is taking place under an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has said it is committed to delivering a credible and transparent election. As part of that effort, around 500 international observers and foreign journalists will be present, including delegations from the European Union and the Commonwealth, to which Bangladesh belongs.

Bangladesh’s Parliament has 350 seats, including 300 elected directly from single-member constituencies and 50 reserved for women. Lawmakers are chosen by plurality and the parliament serves a five-year term. The Election Commission recently postponed voting in one constituency after a candidate died.

The election follows a turbulent period marked by mob violence, attacks on Hindu minorities and the press, the growing influence of Islamists and weakening of the rule of law.

It could reshape the domestic stability of Bangladesh, a country whose post-1971 history since gaining independence from Pakistan has been marked by entrenched political parties, military coups and allegations of vote rigging. Young voters, many of whom played a central role in the 2024 uprising, are expected to be influential. Some 5 million first-time voters are eligible.

“I think it is a very crucial election because this is the first time we can show our opinion with freedom,” said 28-year-old voter Ikram ul Haque, adding that past elections were far from fair.

“We are celebrating the election. It is like a festival here,” he said. “I hope Bangladesh will have exponential change.”

Thursday’s election is a critical test not just of leadership but of trust in Bangladesh’s democratic future. Voters can say “Yes” to endorse major reform proposals that stemmed from a national charter signed by major political parties last year.

If a majority of voters favor the referendum, the newly elected Parliament could form a constitutional reform council to make the changes with 180 working days from its first session. The proposals include the creation of new constitutional bodies and changing Parliament from a single body to a bicameral legislature with an upper house empowered to amend the constitution by majority vote.

The BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami both signed the document with some changes after initially expressing some dissent. Hasina’s Awami League party, which is a major party, and some of its former allies were excluded from the discussion. The referendum has still been criticized for limiting the options put before voters.

Title: Will Varun Chakaravarthy unveil a new delivery against Pakistan? ‘Working on a few’

Text: India spinner Varun Chakaravarthy only needed two overs to dramatically put a halt to Namibia’s momentum in his side’s 93-run in New Delhi on Thursday. His figures of 3/7 in just two overs told the story of just how tough opposition batters still find it to read the ball out of his hand.

But the 34-year-old has been working on a selection of new deliveries to add to his already impressive arsenal. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate had lifted the lid to reporters before the Namibia fixture, and Varun confirmed as much while speaking to the media on Thursday.

“I’ve been working on a few things. That has always been my process. I usually have some delivery coming up,” he said.

Varun added the rider, however, that he takes into account a number of factors before unfurling new deliveries in matches. The surface and condition, as well as the opposition, will likely come into play. Which begs the question: will he do so against Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday?

“It’s up to me if I’m courageous enough to try it in the next match,” he said, before adding there is no set time for how long it takes for him to come up with new deliveries: “There are a few balls that just click for me in some matches and some I have been trying for six years and they still haven’t come of. Depends on the complexity of the delivery.”

After controversy and political tensions have marred the build-up of the high-profile game, the focus has now shifted to cricket and Pakistan’s strong spin attack.

The fact that they are used to those conditions and have the tweakers that can be dangerous on pitches that stay low and slow, will make India’s spin department crucial for their own chances. And Varun will play a central role in that. So too could his new deliveries.

</entities>
Text: A capacity crowd arrived at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground on a breezy, pleasant Thursday evening and spent nearly four hours watching 19 wickets scalped and 18 sixes go into the stands before an ultimately predictable result played itself out.

India’s collective quality – despite an indifferent batting performance and an average new-ball spell – was simply too much to contend with for Namibia, who arrived here as the underdogs and looked the part for much of the contest. The 93-run victory will remain a footnote in the hosts’ grand pursuit to become the first team to defend the World T20 title, and the first to win it at home. The Kotla faithful stayed late into the night and broke into bhangra celebrations at the end, though such scenes are unlikely to be replicated in the dressing room. They are not likely to give it a second thought either.

That India needed nowhere near their best but still looked unplayable at times, with different players coming up with match-winning moments even when the team did not string the dominant collective performance expected against so-called ‘minnows’ bodes well for their title ambitions. It also acted as nifty preparation for the politically-charged and much-hyped encounter against Pakistan on Sunday.

The hosts put up a 209-run total despite a slowdown in the middle and a collapse at the death. Namibia were looking capable of stretching them at 85 for two after nine overs before Varun Chakaravarthy came up with the kind of spell he often does, taking three wickets in two overs, the opposition failing to get a read on him, and crawling to the finish line for an expected loss from there.

The spate of big-hitters at this tournament and the typically flat batting-friendly pitches expected for the India leg of this tournament had inflated expectations of the first 300+ total at a T20 World Cup. Those expectations did not seem unfounded in the first half an hour of this contest, such was the blistering start that India had, powered by Ishan Kishan.

The absence of Abhishek Sharma due to a stomach bug – his presence at the ground was a good omen for his availability against Pakistan in Colombo – gave Sanju Samson a game and he went at the bowlers hard but lost his wicket equally quickly. It was left to Kishan to milk the fast bowlers, and that he did. His offensive 24-ball 61 did not just stand out for its pace but also for its savviness. Diminutive yet destructive, Kishan scrambled the minds of an opposition bowling attack that did not quite have much experience at this level.

He led India to a powerplay score of 85 for 1, but following his dismissal, India’s run rate nearly halved as they struggled to get a read on Namibia’s spinners. Their captain led the charge, the tall fingerspinner Gerhard Erasmus, who ended with career-best figures of four for 20 and got the ball to grip into the flat surface and expose the Indian batting lineup’s tentativeness when conditions are not the way they want them to be.

The same had surfaced when they were reduced to 77 for 6 against USA in the last match. Then, it was heroics from skipper Suryakumar Yadav that brought them out of trouble. Here, it was Kishan’s fast start and Hardik Pandya’s merciless hammering of the spinners later in the innings, inclusive of a 109m six, that was enough for a 200+ total despite another late collapse. The target was imposing enough for the lower-ranked visitors to be under the pump from the start of the run chase, but the feeling that India left a significant amount of runs on the table never abated. The fact that some of them struggled to get going against slow spin does not bode well for the upcoming assignment in Colombo, where conditions favour tweakers.

Ultimately, no lessons were learnt but the job was done. There may be an odd satisfaction in being clinical without needing to be flashy.

Brief Scores: India 209/9 in 20 overs (Ishan Kishan 61, Hardik Pandya 52; Gerhard Erasmus 4/20) beat Namibia 116 all out in 18.2 overs (Louren Steenkamp 29; Varun Chakaravarthy 3/7, Axar Patel 2/20).

Text: 
India approved the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France on Thursday, marking one of its largest aircraft orders, ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the country.

The approval was part of New Delhi's 3.6 trillion rupee ($39.7 billion) defence spending package covering multiple acquisitions across the armed forces.

The Defence Ministry did not specify how many aircraft would be ordered. Local media reported that India will purchase 114 Rafale jets, with 18 supplied by manufacturer Dassault and the remaining 96 manufactured domestically.

The broader package includes Boeing P8I Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft for its navy, anti-tank mines for its ground forces, and upgrades to its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles.

The new aircraft are expected to help address a shortfall in the Indian air force, which operates 29 squadrons against a minimum requirement of 42, according to a 2024 parliamentary report.

The air force most recently retired two squadrons of Cold War-era MiG-21 fighters in September 2025, and is expected to phase out additional aircraft in the coming years.

The Rafale purchase follows another order in April for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for India's Navy. Dassault said India would become the first user outside France to operate this variant.

Rafale jets were used by the Indian Air Force during its 2025 conflict with Pakistan, when at least one aircraft was reported lost in combat against Islamabad's Chinese-made J-10Cs.

Macron, who will be in India from Feb. 17 to 19, is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across sectors.The two leaders will also launch the India-France Year of Innovation and attend the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, according to India's external affairs ministry."The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest, including cooperation in the Indo-Pacific," the release added.

Text: The official X account of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace announced on Thursday that Israel has joined the international organization as a founding member.

With that, Israel is now among 27 other countries that are members of the Council: the United States, Vietnam, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Paraguay, Pakistan, Morocco, Mongolia, Kuwait, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Indonesia, Hungary, Egypt, El Salvador, Cambodia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Bahrain, Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Argentina.

The Board of Peace officially launched its account on X in late January. Its only posts so far have been to welcome the member countries.

The Board of Peace, which was founded as part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, had been launched the previous week in a special ceremony led by Trump during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

A week before that, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he has accepted Trump’s invitation and will join the initiative.

Despite Israel now being an official member, the Prime Minister's Office announced earlier on Thursday that Netanyahu will not be attending the first meeting of the Board of Peace, which is scheduled for next week in Washington. Netanyahu has just returned from Washington, where he met at the White House with Trump.
