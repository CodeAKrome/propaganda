Text: Last spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.

The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education.

"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration," Williams said. "It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before."

Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. "It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission," said Williams.

In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was "in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government."

As mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.

"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur," Lewis said. "What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment."

Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience.

"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart," she said. "And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles."

Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.

In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies.

"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington," Lewis said.

Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.

"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world," Haight said. "I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making."

He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.

"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing," Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.

In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of "unemployment or underemployment."

"There are still so many people looking for work," Rahill said.

Text: When 42-year-old Jacob Trigg lost his job as a project manager in the tech industry he didn't think it would take too long to find a new one - he always had before.

But more than 2,000 job applications later he is still hunting, trying to make ends meet with jobs in package delivery and landscaping.

"It's a huge surprise because I've always been able to get a job very easily," said Trigg, who lives in Texas. "It wasn't even on my radar to be prepared for more than six months of unemployment. It wasn't in my universe."

His difficulties are an indication of a wider freeze in the US labour market, where job openings and hiring rates have dropped to multi-year lows.

Last year the US added an average of just 15,000 jobs a month, very few by historic standards.

The employment slowdown has raised concern about the health of the economy, but evidence of wider deterioration is elusive.

Layoffs have remained limited, apart from some high-profile cuts at firms such as Amazon and UPS and the unemployment rate has held steady at around 4.3%. Meanwhile, the wider economy continues to grow, expanding at a robust annual pace of 4.4% in the most recent figures.

It's a puzzling, and unusual, mix.

"It's actually very hard to point to another moment in the last 25 years where you have the combination we see today," said Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Trigg said he was "battening down the hatches" and hoping that whatever is causing the situation will pass.

But there are growing questions about whether the challenges he is facing could be here to stay.

Last October the investment bank Goldman Sachs put out a report, which was widely cited, suggesting the US could be facing a new period of "jobless growth" thanks to the arrival of new technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, allowing companies to do more with fewer workers.

Concerns about the wider implications of such a change pulsed through discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month and have contributed to widespread economic anxiety in the US.

Economics professor Constantin Burgi of University College, Dublin, said a decoupling of job gains and wider growth - like the one the US is seeing today - often occurs when an economy goes through a structural shift, like the advent of AI.

He noted while AI's promise remains hotly debated, technology has also made outsourcing even easier.

In Burgi's view the situation is likely temporary – but that does not mean it will be short-lived.

"It can be a couple of months but it can also be a couple of years," he said. "If the jobs are really lost due to outsourcing or AI, then unless we find in a couple of years actually we still need those people and replacing them didn't work, then those jobs are gone."

For those in the trenches looking for work, the search is demoralising, regardless of its cause.

James Richardson, a 33-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said without help from his parents, he would be homeless. He has applied to more than 1,200 jobs since being let go from his role as an information security analyst for a government contractor in October.

Sometimes his application is rejected within 15 minutes of submission, he said.

"It feels like there is no-one on the other side even bothering to take a look at your experiences and credentials."

It remains unclear whether the jobs slowdown is actually due solely or even mostly to technological change.

Research suggests job losses due to AI have remained concentrated to just a few sectors.

And many US firms, especially in tech, still have on their payrolls a glut of workers who were brought on during the pandemic, when there was a small hiring boom. That could also help explain the lack of new vacancies.

The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration is also curbing population growth. That makes it harder to find workers, but it also means fewer are needed.

Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, said in her view another reason hiring appetites took a hit last year was the uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's cuts to government spending and his programme of tariffs.

Assuming the economy remains strong, she does not think the new jobs numbers will stay this low.

"I would definitely not call it a new normal, because I don't think it's normal," she said. "I don't think you can sustain the kind of labour market that we're in over the long term.

"Having a very low-hire, low-fire, low-quits environment in a period of economic growth can only last so long."

Stronger-than-expected job gains in January could be a sign that hope is on the horizon for job seekers.

But there are plenty of wild cards ahead, as Ullrich and others are quick to acknowledge.

As the economy grows increasingly reliant on spending by the very wealthy, it has also become more vulnerable to a sudden downward correction in share prices.

AI could prove as transformative as its most optimistic backers are predicting.

Or the US could enter a period of lower growth, if restricting immigration takes the wind out of the economy.

Amy Beson, who was laid off in April as part of wider job cuts at the University of Arizona, said she was not expecting things to improve anytime soon.

Universities have seen funding cuts from the government, making it harder for the 47-year-old to find the kind of work that used to be supported by grant programmes.

Meanwhile, she fears competition from the ranks of newly unemployed government workers.

Even expanding her search to healthcare, where she previously worked and which is considered one of the economy's most resilient sectors, has not helped.

"It definitely is the most desperate I've ever felt," she said. "I do worry that this is the new normal."

Text: Last year, an explosion at U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works outside Pittsburgh killed two U.S. Steel workers and injured 11 others, including contractors

CLAIRTON, Pa. -- For Don Furko, Aug. 11, 2025, was a normal shift. Until it became the shift he would never forget.

At 10:47 a.m., U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works outside Pittsburgh — a sprawling riverside industrial facility and the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere — erupted in an ear-piercing boom.

A steelworker for 25 years and former Clairton local union president, Furko pulled on flame-retardant jacket and pants, a hard hat and safety glasses, left his post and rushed to the black plume of smoke rising from the facility’s batteries — the massive arrangements of industrial ovens that heat coal to some 2,000 degrees, turning it into carbon-rich coke.

Near the wharf, Renee Hough, a utility technician in charge of loading coke, sat in the cab of the plant’s screening station when the explosion ripped through the air, blinding her in black dust. “My first thought was I was dead,” Hough recalls. Flames emerged as the dust settled, and a voice crackled through the radio: Battery 13 had just exploded.

“I can’t even explain how mangled everything was,” Furko recalls. “There were flames everywhere.” Workers shuttled the injured to the helipad for evacuation. Through the chaos, Furko heard a fellow steelworker screaming, buried beneath the rubble.

The blast killed two U.S. Steel workers and injured 11 others, including contractors, according to the Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency investigating the incident.

Six months later, workers remain rattled and community concerns about air pollution from the plant are heightened.

The blast comes on top of a string of other accidents at the Clairton plant over time as well as a long history of legal battles between U.S. Steel and Allegheny County regulators, who regularly accuse the company of flouting environmental rules at the facility. As recently as Jan. 27, pollution control equipment at the Clairton plant temporarily broke down and nearby air monitors recorded elevated air pollution, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.

To U.S. Steel’s critics, the August blast highlighted chronic problems at the facility. And some current and former workers at Clairton Coke Works say poor management and underinvestment have exacerbated air pollution and undermined workplace safety at the plant where operators already have little margin for error, Pittsburgh’s Public Source and The Associated Press have found.

The August explosion also came after Nippon Steel’s $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel in June 2025. It’s an open question whether the Japanese steel company will invest significantly in Clairton Coke Works and address issues raised by workers, government officials and environmental watchdogs.

The Chemical Safety Board has said that the August explosion occurred while workers were preparing to replace a damaged valve that was detected in July, as well as other valves. The agency’s investigation continues; it said in December that it has identified “potentially unmitigated hazards for workers at Clairton Coke Works that warrant immediate attention.”

“They try to say ‘safety first, safety first,’” said Brian Pavlack, a current worker at Clairton Coke Works. “Safety is not the first priority for them.”

Nippon Steel did not provide a response to written questions. In a written statement responding to detailed questions, U.S. Steel stressed its commitment to safety.

“Safety is our core value and shapes our culture, influences how we lead, and anchors our responsibility to ensure that every employee returns home safely, every single day,” the company said.

The 392-acre Clairton Coke Works opened more than a century ago, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh along the west bank of the Monongahela River. The ovens at the plant heat coal at high temperatures for hours to make coke, a key component in steelmaking. Its ovens produce 3.6 million tons of coke annually, which is shipped to the company’s operations farther up the river at the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, and to U.S. Steel’s Gary Works in Indiana.

But making coke isn’t a clean process or without risk. The heat removes impurities, producing a flammable byproduct called coke oven gas. Coke oven gas includes hydrogen, methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and some of it is used as fuel to heat the coke ovens. Coke oven gas is explosive due to high hydrogen content, said Fred Rorick, a former operations manager at Bethlehem Steel and steel industry consultant.

“At a coke works, when you have that, you have to be very, very, very careful,” Rorick said.

According to the Chemical Safety Board, the August explosion happened while workers were closing and opening a gas isolation valve in a basement after pumping water into the valve. U.S. Steel’s written procedure did not mention the use of water and a U.S. Steel supervisor directed workers to pump the water, the agency said. Kurt Barshick, U.S. Steel’s vice president of the Mon Valley Works, said during an October presentation to residents in the wake of the August explosion that workers trapped “3,000 PSI water inside of a valve that’s rated for 50 PSI.” The valve cracked and gas filled the area, Barshick added.

Drew Sahli, the Chemical Safety Board’s investigator in charge, said there was a “release of coke oven gas” and that the gas “contacted an ignition source” and exploded. The agency is still investigating how the gas was released, Sahli said.

U.S. Steel said it has “strengthened several safety protocols” based on its own ongoing investigation, including prohibiting the use of high-pressure water for valve cleaning and reviewing their “Management of Change program, which assesses proposed changes in procedures and evaluates risk.”

Before the August blast, Clairton Coke Works already had a history of accidents and explosions.

—In 2009, a maintenance worker was killed in a blast.

—In 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors.

—In 2014, a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.

—In February 2025, a problem at a battery led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, injuring two people, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.

After the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced to $78,500 under a settlement agreement. U.S. Steel admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

While there’s “a lot of ways that you can get yourself hurt or killed” at Clairton Coke Works, explosions are the biggest hazard, said Calvin Croftcheck, who previously worked at the plant and served as the United Steelworkers safety coordinator for U.S. Steel.

“Since 2009, there have been three accidents that have resulted in fatalities and that is just not common in today’s age of safety,” said Phillip Kondrot, a workers’ compensation attorney who represents workers injured at Clairton Coke Works. “That is a dangerous place to work.”

“We have intensive procedures that are currently in place at Clairton and our other facilities, and our employees are charged with following them,” U.S. Steel said. “We will not respond to comments from for-profit lawyers and stand behind the safety professionals who tirelessly work at U. S. Steel.”

Some current and former workers at the Clairton plant fault U.S. Steel’s management of the aging facility, saying that it has caused a range of operational problems.

“A lot of things that have happened there, where they needed something fixed and something went wrong, it was because corporate wouldn’t approve them ordering the parts,” said Jonathan Ledwich, who worked at Clairton Coke Works between 2011 and 2022 trying to prevent emission leaks from the coke ovens. “We did the best we could with what we had.”

Ledwich points to a fire at the Clairton plant on Christmas Eve 2018. It shut down pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, according to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups after the incident. In the wake of the fire, Allegheny County warned residents to limit outdoor activities, with residents saying for weeks afterward that the air smelled like rotten eggs and was hard to breathe.

Ranajit Sahu, an engineer hired by the plaintiffs, wrote in a report filed in the case that he found “no indication” that U.S. Steel “has an effective, comprehensive maintenance program for the Clairton plant.” Sahu also wrote that the 2018 accident, which was precipitated by piping falling due to corrosion, was “preventable by a robust inspection and preventive maintenance program and by better plant design.”

In a 2024 consent decree settling the lawsuit, U.S. Steel agreed to measures including investing close to $20 million in facility upgrades and permanently idling a battery of coke ovens at the plant. As part of the consent decree, U.S. Steel admitted no liability.

Hough, the utility technician in charge of loading coke, said that the lack of proactive maintenance at Clairton Coke Works makes her feel unsafe at times.

“There’s a lot of things that need to be repaired that they’re not prioritizing because you can’t stop production,” Hough said of U.S. Steel.

Some current and former plant workers also describe difficulty getting coke oven doors replaced. Ledwich, the former Clairton steel worker, said some doors that needed to be replaced would leak emissions.

In a 2020 deposition for the lawsuit related to the 2018 Christmas Eve fire, James Kelly, former deputy director of the environmental health bureau at the Allegheny County Health Department – the agency that oversees emissions at the plant – said the facility is “one of the most decrepit facilities” that he’d ever seen.

The litigation surrounding the Christmas Eve fire wasn’t the first time U.S. Steel was accused in court of skimping on maintenance. In a 2017 amended federal class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws, U.S. Steel shareholders said that the company CEO hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 2014 after multiple unprofitable years and “implemented extreme cost-cutting measures” in 2015 involving layoffs and deferrals of “desperately-needed maintenance and repairs.” The lawsuit was eventually settled and the U.S. Steel defendants admitted no wrongdoing.

U.S. Steel had “one of the best safety staffs in the country,” said Mike Wright, former director of the health, safety, and environment department at the United Steelworkers. But key safety department leaders were fired, according to Wright and Croftcheck, the former union safety coordinator. Wright said the dismissals occurred in 2016.

Ed Mazurkiewicz, former director of safety and industrial hygiene at U.S. Steel, said that he was let go by the company in 2016. While he knew at the time that McKinsey had been “evaluating all of U.S. Steel” and that there would be downsizing, it was still a shock when his job was eliminated, Mazurkiewicz said.

U.S. Steel said it has “worked with many advisers and partners” over the years and that the company’s “overall transformation efforts have improved our company’s performance, created a robust maintenance program, and improved employee safety over time.” In response to questions about U.S. Steel’s safety department and the firing of department leaders, the company said: “We cannot comment on personnel matters.”

“They brought in McKinsey to tell them really how to run things,” Wright said of U.S. Steel. “We were a little outraged by that.”

McKinsey said in a statement that the company is one of “many advisers that have served U.S. Steel in support of its efforts to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States, improve operational resiliency, and invest in and support the communities in which it operates.”

“As with all our work for the company – and with all our clients – safety is always a top priority,” the company added.

Maintenance practices have changed over time, some current and former workers say.

“I used to see a lot more maintenance and taking care of things and fixing things before they broke, or replacing things that were worn out,” said Hough, who has worked at the plant for 29 years. “That used to happen back when I was first hired there, and that hasn’t happened in the last 10 or so years.”

For years, Clairton Coke Works has drawn the ire of government regulators, environmental advocates and community members concerned about air pollution originating from the plant. Air quality in the region has improved over time, but the Clairton plant has been the largest local source of air pollution – such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter – in recent years, according to the Allegheny County Health Department. Particulate matter, for instance, is linked to various health issues, including heart attacks and aggravated asthma. The plant also emits carcinogenic benzene.

While the Clairton plant is allowed to emit some air pollution, county Health Department regulators routinely clash with U.S. Steel over alleged violations of the plant’s operating permit, such as excessive emissions or failing to use pollution control equipment. In 2023, for instance, the Allegheny County Health Department fined U.S. Steel more than $2 million for violations at Clairton Coke Works.

“You’re sort of in this cycle of patching, monitoring, fining, patching, monitoring, fining, and it’s never really good enough,” said Karen Hacker, director of the Allegheny County Health Department between 2013 and 2019. “You can’t say it hasn’t improved. Just look at the sky in Pittsburgh, right? But it hasn’t removed a source of pollution.”

In response to questions from Public Source and AP, the Allegheny County Health Department said in a written statement that the agency “inspects coking operations daily” and “addresses violations as discovered during inspections” with a full compliance evaluation every two years.

The department also said that air monitoring stations near the Clairton plant “have measured a 15-25% reduction in annual average particle pollution concentrations compared to ten years ago.” The department declined to comment on “open investigations, enforcement orders, or pending litigation.”

Nationally, Clairton Coke Works’ environmental compliance track record is an outlier, according to a Public Source and AP analysis of federal Clean Air Act data from about 14,000 facilities. The analysis found that Clairton Coke Works is classified by the EPA as a “high-priority violator” – only about 11% of major emitters fall into that category. It’s even rarer for facilities to garner financial penalties on the magnitude that Clairton Coke Works has faced in the last five years, the analysis shows. Just 11 facilities, including Clairton Coke Works, have faced $10 million in penalties or more in the last five years.

“It’s a massive facility. It’s a complex facility and it’s an underfunded facility,” said Adam Ortiz, former EPA regional administrator of the Mid-Atlantic region during the Biden administration. “All those things make it tough.”

U.S. Steel said in its statement that the company spends “$100 million annually on environmental compliance at Clairton alone and has consistently achieved an environmental compliance rate exceeding 99% for regulated activities per year at our Clairton Plant, the largest cokemaking facility in North America.”

The company said that it has “invested more than $750 million in environmental improvement projects in the Mon Valley” and that preliminary data shows that a county air monitor located downwind of the Clairton plant has met the Environmental Protection Agency’s national ambient air quality standard for particulate matter since 2024.

“Our steadfast pursuit of environmental excellence will continue,” the company said. “We maintain a productive relationship with the ACHD and other regulators, with a commitment to regulation grounded in science and law.”

Some environmental advocates have argued that the Allegheny County Health Department is outgunned against U.S. Steel. The department’s air quality program, which handles oversight of Clairton Coke Works, is funded by fees paid by industrial polluters. But the program has struggled financially in recent years. In a 2018 report, the EPA asserted that revenue from emissions-based fees was “diminishing as a result of emissions reductions” and that the existing fee structure could potentially “undermine long-term program sustainability.” The Allegheny County Council approved raising the fees in 2021 and again in November.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signaled that it is taking a more hands-off approach with polluters. In November, President Donald Trump temporarily exempted Clairton Coke Works and other coking plants from provisions of a Biden-era rule that, for instance, required fenceline monitoring for benzene emissions. U.S. Steel previously requested an exemption.

U.S. Steel said that the rule “imposed significant compliance costs while setting technically unachievable standards and providing little or no environmental benefit.” Its Mon Valley facilities have “never been fined” for exceeding benzene emission standards, the company said.

Before the August explosion, workers and outside observers were already watching Nippon Steel closely for clues about their plans for Clairton Coke Works and the Mon Valley. Now, questions about Nippon’s intentions have become even more pressing.

In the nearly $15 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel pledged to invest $14 billion in domestic steelmaking operations, including building a new electric arc furnace somewhere in the U.S. Much of that money remains publicly uncommitted, and U.S. Steel has been firm that it wants to keep the Clairton plant operating.

“The Clairton Coke Plant is an important part of our North American Flat-Rolled integrated operations,” the company said in November. The company added that a “steady coke supply remains critical” and that the “Clairton Coke Plant will be maintained for the next generation of steelmaking.”

Since Nippon Steel acquired the company, things have started to change, according to Hough. The company has invested more in repairs and preventative maintenance, she said.

“Nippon is putting the money into the plant, and let me tell you, they’ve got a long way to go,” Hough said. “U.S. Steel let it go so bad for so long.”

However, U.S. Steel has not publicly committed to spending money at the Clairton plant to expand production, extend its life, improve efficiency, upgrade safety or reduce its polluting air emissions.

In response to questions about its investment plans for Clairton Coke Works, U.S. Steel said the company plans to invest “more than $2 billion at Mon Valley Works.”

Furko served as Clairton local union president in 2021 when U.S. Steel canceled a pledged $1 billion investment in the Mon Valley Works. He remains wary of Nippon’s promises.

“Until I see shovels start to hit dirt,” Furko said, “then I don’t believe it until I see it.”

Of the $14 billion, U.S. Steel has said $2.4 billion will go toward its Pittsburgh-area plants. A portion of that money will be spent on building a new hot strip mill to replace the one at its Irvin plant, just down the Monongahela River from Clairton, that processes steel into massive sheet rolls, primarily for the automotive, appliance and construction industries.

It’s unclear how Nippon and U.S. Steel will address recent findings from federal investigators. In December, the Chemical Safety Board recommended that U.S. Steel conduct a siting evaluation of all buildings at the Clairton plant that are occupied or could be occupied to identify and assess potential hazards for workers. The agency said that the company has not conducted a facility siting evaluation as part of efforts to rebuild and relocate its “personnel facilities” after the blast.

U.S. Steel continues to cooperate with the Chemical Safety Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and “evaluate their recommendations,” the company said.

Even with Nippon’s promise of revitalizing U.S. Steel with billions of dollars of investment, the August explosion is still darkening the minds of workers. Furko said he struggles to motivate himself to go to work on some days.

“I’ve been there 25 years. There’s been guys who have lost legs from rail equipment running over them. Bad falls and stuff like that,” Furko said. “Nothing has affected me like this has.”

CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) -- For Don Furko, Aug. 11, 2025, was a normal shift. Until it became the shift he would never forget.

At 10:47 a.m., U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works outside Pittsburgh -- a sprawling riverside industrial facility and the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere -- erupted in an ear-piercing boom.

A steelworker for 25 years and former Clairton local union president, Furko pulled on flame-retardant jacket and pants, a hard hat and safety glasses, left his post and rushed to the black plume of smoke rising from the facility's batteries -- the massive arrangements of industrial ovens that heat coal to some 2,000 degrees, turning it into carbon-rich coke.

Near the wharf, Renee Hough, a utility technician in charge of loading coke, sat in the cab of the plant's screening station when the explosion ripped through the air, blinding her in black dust. "My first thought was I was dead," Hough recalls. Flames emerged as the dust settled, and a voice crackled through the radio: Battery 13 had just exploded.

"I can't even explain how mangled everything was," Furko recalls. "There were flames everywhere." Workers shuttled the injured to the helipad for evacuation. Through the chaos, Furko heard a fellow steelworker screaming, buried beneath the rubble.

The blast killed two U.S. Steel workers and injured 11 others, including contractors, according to the Chemical Safety Board, a federal agency investigating the incident.

Six months later, workers remain rattled and community concerns about air pollution from the plant are heightened.

The blast comes on top of a string of other accidents at the Clairton plant over time as well as a long history of legal battles between U.S. Steel and Allegheny County regulators, who regularly accuse the company of flouting environmental rules at the facility. As recently as Jan. 27, pollution control equipment at the Clairton plant temporarily broke down and nearby air monitors recorded elevated air pollution, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.

To U.S. Steel's critics, the August blast highlighted chronic problems at the facility. And some current and former workers at Clairton Coke Works say poor management and underinvestment have exacerbated air pollution and undermined workplace safety at the plant where operators already have little margin for error, Pittsburgh's Public Source and The Associated Press have found.

The August explosion also came after Nippon Steel's $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel in June 2025. It's an open question whether the Japanese steel company will invest significantly in Clairton Coke Works and address issues raised by workers, government officials and environmental watchdogs.

The Chemical Safety Board has said that the August explosion occurred while workers were preparing to replace a damaged valve that was detected in July, as well as other valves. The agency's investigation continues; it said in December that it has identified "potentially unmitigated hazards for workers at Clairton Coke Works that warrant immediate attention."

"They try to say 'safety first, safety first,'" said Brian Pavlack, a current worker at Clairton Coke Works. "Safety is not the first priority for them."

Nippon Steel did not provide a response to written questions. In a written statement responding to detailed questions, U.S. Steel stressed its commitment to safety.

"Safety is our core value and shapes our culture, influences how we lead, and anchors our responsibility to ensure that every employee returns home safely, every single day," the company said.

Dangerous work

The 392-acre Clairton Coke Works opened more than a century ago, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh along the west bank of the Monongahela River. The ovens at the plant heat coal at high temperatures for hours to make coke, a key component in steelmaking. Its ovens produce 3.6 million tons of coke annually, which is shipped to the company's operations farther up the river at the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, and to U.S. Steel's Gary Works in Indiana.

But making coke isn't a clean process or without risk. The heat removes impurities, producing a flammable byproduct called coke oven gas. Coke oven gas includes hydrogen, methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and some of it is used as fuel to heat the coke ovens. Coke oven gas is explosive due to high hydrogen content, said Fred Rorick, a former operations manager at Bethlehem Steel and steel industry consultant.

"At a coke works, when you have that, you have to be very, very, very careful," Rorick said.

According to the Chemical Safety Board, the August explosion happened while workers were closing and opening a gas isolation valve in a basement after pumping water into the valve. U.S. Steel's written procedure did not mention the use of water and a U.S. Steel supervisor directed workers to pump the water, the agency said. Kurt Barshick, U.S. Steel's vice president of the Mon Valley Works, said during an October presentation to residents in the wake of the August explosion that workers trapped "3,000 PSI water inside of a valve that's rated for 50 PSI." The valve cracked and gas filled the area, Barshick added.

Drew Sahli, the Chemical Safety Board's investigator in charge, said there was a "release of coke oven gas" and that the gas "contacted an ignition source" and exploded. The agency is still investigating how the gas was released, Sahli said.

U.S. Steel said it has "strengthened several safety protocols" based on its own ongoing investigation, including prohibiting the use of high-pressure water for valve cleaning and reviewing their "Management of Change program, which assesses proposed changes in procedures and evaluates risk."

Before the August blast, Clairton Coke Works already had a history of accidents and explosions.

--In 2009, a maintenance worker was killed in a blast.

--In 2010, an explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors.

--In 2014, a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.

--In February 2025, a problem at a battery led to a "buildup of combustible material" that ignited, injuring two people, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.

After the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and fines, which were later reduced to $78,500 under a settlement agreement. U.S. Steel admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

While there's "a lot of ways that you can get yourself hurt or killed" at Clairton Coke Works, explosions are the biggest hazard, said Calvin Croftcheck, who previously worked at the plant and served as the United Steelworkers safety coordinator for U.S. Steel.

"Since 2009, there have been three accidents that have resulted in fatalities and that is just not common in today's age of safety," said Phillip Kondrot, a workers' compensation attorney who represents workers injured at Clairton Coke Works. "That is a dangerous place to work."

"We have intensive procedures that are currently in place at Clairton and our other facilities, and our employees are charged with following them," U.S. Steel said. "We will not respond to comments from for-profit lawyers and stand behind the safety professionals who tirelessly work at U. S. Steel."

Management questioned

Some current and former workers at the Clairton plant fault U.S. Steel's management of the aging facility, saying that it has caused a range of operational problems.

"A lot of things that have happened there, where they needed something fixed and something went wrong, it was because corporate wouldn't approve them ordering the parts," said Jonathan Ledwich, who worked at Clairton Coke Works between 2011 and 2022 trying to prevent emission leaks from the coke ovens. "We did the best we could with what we had."

Ledwich points to a fire at the Clairton plant on Christmas Eve 2018. It shut down pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, according to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups after the incident. In the wake of the fire, Allegheny County warned residents to limit outdoor activities, with residents saying for weeks afterward that the air smelled like rotten eggs and was hard to breathe.

Ranajit Sahu, an engineer hired by the plaintiffs, wrote in a report filed in the case that he found "no indication" that U.S. Steel "has an effective, comprehensive maintenance program for the Clairton plant." Sahu also wrote that the 2018 accident, which was precipitated by piping falling due to corrosion, was "preventable by a robust inspection and preventive maintenance program and by better plant design."

In a 2024 consent decree settling the lawsuit, U.S. Steel agreed to measures including investing close to $20 million in facility upgrades and permanently idling a battery of coke ovens at the plant. As part of the consent decree, U.S. Steel admitted no liability.

Hough, the utility technician in charge of loading coke, said that the lack of proactive maintenance at Clairton Coke Works makes her feel unsafe at times.

"There's a lot of things that need to be repaired that they're not prioritizing because you can't stop production," Hough said of U.S. Steel.

Some current and former plant workers also describe difficulty getting coke oven doors replaced. Ledwich, the former Clairton steel worker, said some doors that needed to be replaced would leak emissions.

In a 2020 deposition for the lawsuit related to the 2018 Christmas Eve fire, James Kelly, former deputy director of the environmental health bureau at the Allegheny County Health Department -- the agency that oversees emissions at the plant -- said the facility is "one of the most decrepit facilities" that he'd ever seen.

The litigation surrounding the Christmas Eve fire wasn't the first time U.S. Steel was accused in court of skimping on maintenance. In a 2017 amended federal class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws, U.S. Steel shareholders said that the company CEO hired the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 2014 after multiple unprofitable years and "implemented extreme cost-cutting measures" in 2015 involving layoffs and deferrals of "desperately-needed maintenance and repairs." The lawsuit was eventually settled and the U.S. Steel defendants admitted no wrongdoing.

U.S. Steel had "one of the best safety staffs in the country," said Mike Wright, former director of the health, safety, and environment department at the United Steelworkers. But key safety department leaders were fired, according to Wright and Croftcheck, the former union safety coordinator. Wright said the dismissals occurred in 2016.

Ed Mazurkiewicz, former director of safety and industrial hygiene at U.S. Steel, said that he was let go by the company in 2016. While he knew at the time that McKinsey had been "evaluating all of U.S. Steel" and that there would be downsizing, it was still a shock when his job was eliminated, Mazurkiewicz said.

U.S. Steel said it has "worked with many advisers and partners" over the years and that the company's "overall transformation efforts have improved our company's performance, created a robust maintenance program, and improved employee safety over time." In response to questions about U.S. Steel's safety department and the firing of department leaders, the company said: "We cannot comment on personnel matters."

"They brought in McKinsey to tell them really how to run things," Wright said of U.S. Steel. "We were a little outraged by that."

McKinsey said in a statement that the company is one of "many advisers that have served U.S. Steel in support of its efforts to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States, improve operational resiliency, and invest in and support the communities in which it operates."

"As with all our work for the company -- and with all our clients -- safety is always a top priority," the company added.

Maintenance practices have changed over time, some current and former workers say.

"I used to see a lot more maintenance and taking care of things and fixing things before they broke, or replacing things that were worn out," said Hough, who has worked at the plant for 29 years. "That used to happen back when I was first hired there, and that hasn't happened in the last 10 or so years."

Text: Health experts say the federal government now shares less public health data, even after Robert F_ Kennedy Jr_ promised “radical transparency.”

NEW YORK -- A year ago, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wanted to rebuild trust in federal health agencies, and vowed to employ “radical transparency” to do it.

But many types of health information that steadily flowed from the government for years or decades has been delayed, deleted and in some cases stopped all together.

The collection and sharing of information was hurt by sweeping layoffs at federal agencies and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Officials took down health agency websites to comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump, causing outside researchers to archive federal health datasets and leading to a lawsuit that ended with a judge ordering the websites' restoration.

Ariel Beccia, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said changes in the flow of federal health information have made her angry.

“We pay taxes to hopefully have good, inclusive public health practice and data,” said Beccia, who focuses on the health of LGBTQ youth. “The past year it felt like every single day, something that I and my colleagues use daily in our work has just been taken away” by federal officials.

Asked about now-unavailable data and information, a spokesman for Kennedy said the premise of The Associated Press' inquiry was flawed and relied on selective and inaccurate characterizations.

“Secretary Kennedy is leading the most transparent HHS in history, with unprecedented disclosure and openness aimed at restoring public trust in federal health agencies,” said the spokesman, Andrew Nixon.

He pointed to an HHS webpage on the agency's transparency efforts, which includes a list of canceled government contracts and the repackaging of previously available information — including a U.S. Food and Drug Administration “chemical contaminants transparency tool.”

Here are some examples of how less information is coming out of federal public health agencies than in past administrations.

The Project 2025 blueprint that’s been influential to the Trump administration called for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to enhance its data collection of U.S. abortions, but the agency failed to post its annual abortion surveillance report in November. (Nixon said it will come out this spring.)

HHS officials blamed the delay on the CDC's former chief medical officer, Dr. Debra Houry, saying she directed staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it. But Houry — who resigned months before the report was slated to come out — said that claim was false. She says the report was derailed because of HHS cutbacks to the funding and staff needed to get it done.

Fighting the nation's overdose epidemic has long been a priority for both Republicans and Democrats. And the federal government has continued to collect and report on death certificate-based information on drug deaths.

But the Trump administration curtailed other kinds of overdose work, including shutting down the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which tracked emergency department visits — an early alert about drug-use trends. It was discontinued “as part of a broader effort to align agency activities with agency and administration priorities,” officials posted.

Nixon said past DAWN data will remain available. But some experts say that's not enough, and recently likened the termination of DAWN and other recent changes to spreading cracks in a windshield that makes it harder to see what's ahead in the epidemic.

Smoking has long been known as the nation's leading preventable cause of death. The federal government for decades has not only monitored what percentage of people use cigarettes and other tobacco products, but also run successful public education campaigns like the FDA’s “Real Cost” and the CDC’s “Tips from Former Smokers.”

Those campaigns were ended last year, although Nixon said the FDA campaign will return.

Meanwhile, layoffs to CDC staff who worked on smoking meant an important survey on youth smoking and vaping — normally out in the fall — was never released. Those layoffs also put a stop to work on a report on smoking for the Office of the U.S. Surgeon General.

For three decades, federal health officials tracked food poisoning infections caused by eight germs. In July, the Trump administration scaled back required reporting to just two pathogens monitored by the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, known as FoodNet.

Under the change, health departments in 10 states that participate in the joint state and federal program only monitor infections caused by salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Tracking is optional for infections caused by campylobacter, cyclospora, listeria, shigella, vibrio and Yersinia.

CDC officials said the change would allow the agency to “steward resources effectively.” Food safety experts said the move undercuts the nation’s ability to accurately monitor risks in the U.S. food supply.

Even before Kennedy was confirmed, President Donald Trump signed executive orders to roll back protections for transgender people and terminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

That caused the CDC to remove from its website a range of information about HIV and transgender people. The government also stopped collecting and reporting crucial survey findings on transgender students — data that has shown higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems.

That data is used to help fund and focus suicide-prevention programs and other efforts. And this is all happening as the federal and some state governments try to discourage gender-affirming care, ban transgender youth from sports and dictate which bathrooms they can use, Beccia said.

“Without the data, we can't systematically show the harm that’s being done” by these policies, Beccia said.

Nixon said the data collection and reporting now aligns with agency priorities.

Before he was health secretary, Kennedy was a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement and repeatedly accused federal health advisers of conflicts of interest that aligned them with vaccine-makers. In June, he dismissed the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and named his own replacements.

A federal official said the government would release ethics forms for the new members. But it didn't.

Meanwhile, a CDC website that compiles disclosures by past and current ACIP members has more than 200 entries of former panel members, but information on only one Kennedy appointee. Among those missing from that list are Martin Kulldorff, the initial chair of Kennedy's reconstituted committee, who had been paid to be an expert witness in legal cases against the vaccine-maker Merck. Another is current member Dr. Robert Malone, who also was paid as an expert witness in vaccine litigation.

Text: Pinterest shares plunged as much as 20% after hours Thursday as CEO Bill Ready said the company "absorbed an exogenous shock this year related to tariffs" that affected top retail advertisers.

The company reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss, revenue that was roughly in line with expectations and issued weak guidance for the current period.

Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:

Ready told analysts on Thursday that the company is "not satisfied with our Q4 revenue performance, and believe it does not reflect what Pinterest can deliver over time."

The company's fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year-to-year. Net income for the fourth quarter came in at $277 million, down 85% from a year prior, when net income was $1.85 billion and included a deferred tax benefit.

This is the second quarter in a row in which Pinterest shed a fifth of its value after delivering Wall Street disappointing results. The impact of tariffs on large retailers "created a more meaningful headwind than we expected," Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said on the call with analysts. Those retailers also pulled back on ad spend in Europe, she said.

The retail sector has been reeling from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, which raised the price of shipping costs. The trade war has also led to companies charging customers higher prices and reducing the number of products they can put on the market. Besides implementing layoffs, the retail sector also pulled back on advertising to deal with the ongoing trade issues.

Pinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $951 million to $971 million, trailing analyst estimates of $980 million.

"Looking ahead to Q1, we expect these headwinds will continue and may become slightly more pronounced in Q1, including in the U.K. and in Europe," Donnelly said.

Pinterest recorded $541.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That figure fell short of the $550 million that analysts were projecting.

While Pinterest sees "opportunity over the long term" from large advertisers, Ready said "the near-term outlook for this cohort on our platform remains pressured given these headwinds."

The company plans to more heavily court small-to-medium-sized and international advertisers so its core online ad business doesn't rely so heavily on large retailers, Ready said.

"Most importantly, we need to further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go-to-market transformation," he said.

The disappointing results come after the company in January announced that  it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and reduce its office space in an effort to shift resources to technical teams prioritizing the development of "AI-powered products and capabilities."

Pinterest then fired staffers who built a tool to quantify the layoffs, and Ready admonished them during a companywide meeting, saying that "there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist," CNBC reported.

The January restructuring and ongoing sales unit overhaul "may cause some near term disruption, which we factored into our guidance to be prudent," Donnelly said on Thursday.

Despite the results and gloomy outlook, Pinterest said that fourth-quarter global monthly active users jumped 12% year-over-year to 619 million, representing an all-time high. Wall Street was expecting that figure to be 613 million.

Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada region came in at $979 million, which was ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $973 million.
