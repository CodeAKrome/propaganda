Text: A whistleblower complaint filed against Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence, has ignited significant controversy surrounding the handling of classified intelligence related to Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the complaint stems from an intercepted conversation between two foreign nationals discussing Kushner, which was collected by a foreign intelligence service and passed to the US National Security Agency (NSA). The intelligence mentions Kushner’s influence in US foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran.

The conversation, which took place last year, included speculation about Kushner's role in Middle East peace talks and issues concerning Iran, but the claims were largely unsubstantiated, with US officials from the Trump administration dismissing them as false.

Despite this, the whistleblower has raised concerns that Gabbard’s office intentionally restricted access to the intelligence report, delaying its distribution for months. The WSJ reported that the complaint accuses Gabbard of limiting who could view the report after she met with White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. Some officials involved in the matter suggested that had the report been shared more broadly, it might have been quickly dismissed as unimportant. However, the whistleblower believes the intelligence should have been made available to relevant agencies, and Gabbard’s actions were politically motivated.

While Gabbard's office has denied these claims, asserting that the intelligence was handled properly to protect national security, the delayed release of the report has raised questions in Congress. A heavily redacted version of the complaint was finally presented to select lawmakers, and some Democrats have called for further investigation into why the complaint was stalled for so long. The WSJ noted that Gabbard’s office has defended her actions, stating that she was simply following legal and procedural guidelines.

Meanwhile, the New York Times expanded on the details surrounding the content of the intercepted conversation. According to the newspaper, the conversation, which was passed to the US by a foreign intelligence service, primarily focused on Iran but also included mentions of Kushner, although his name was initially redacted in the intelligence report. The foreign nationals reportedly discussed Kushner’s influence on US foreign policy, at a time when his involvement in Middle East peace talks was becoming more prominent. However, the discussion also included unverified gossip, some of which was demonstrably false, according to US officials familiar with the intelligence.

The NYT further reported that the conversation's inclusion of Kushner’s name raised questions because American officials, particularly those closely tied to the Trump administration, are typically masked in intelligence intercepts. While Gabbard’s office restricted access to the report, some officials believe she was acting out of caution, as revealing the intelligence could have compromised sensitive sources and methods.

The NYT also noted that while the claims in the Kushner-related conversation were speculative and not corroborated by other intelligence, the decision to limit the distribution of the report has been controversial. Some critics argue that Gabbard’s actions were intended to protect an ally of President Trump from scrutiny, while others suggest that her handling of the report was a practical move to avoid unnecessary political fallout.

The complaint and the surrounding investigation remain classified, but some lawmakers, including Senator Mark Warner, have called for full access to the underlying intelligence materials, which have yet to be shared in their entirety.

Text: The death toll from a crackdown over Iran’s nationwide protests last month has reached at least 7,002 people killed with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.

The slow rise in the number of dead from the demonstrations adds to the overall tensions facing Iran both inside the country and abroad as it tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program.

A second round of talks remains up in the air as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed his case directly with US President Donald Trump to intensify his demands on Tehran in the negotiations.

“There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated. If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump wrote afterward on his TruthSocial website.

“Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit. … That did not work well for them. Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible.”

Meanwhile, Iran at home faces still-simmering anger over its wide-ranging suppression of all dissent in the Islamic Republic.

That rage may intensify in the coming days as families of the dead begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning for the loved ones.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which offered the latest figures, has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths.

The slow rise in the death toll has come as the agency slowly is able to crosscheck information as communication remains difficult with those inside of the Islamic Republic.

Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.

The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.

The rise in the death toll comes as Iran tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program.

Senior Iranian security official Ali Larijani met Wednesday in Qatar with Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.

Qatar hosts a major US military installation that Iran attacked in June, after the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June.

Larijani also met with officials of the Palestinian Hamas militant group, and in Oman with Tehran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on Tuesday.

Larijani told Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network that Iran did not receive any specific proposal from the US in Oman, but acknowledged that there was an “exchange of messages.”

Qatar has been a key negotiator in the past with Iran, with which it shares a massive offshore natural gas field in the Persian Gulf.

Its state-run Qatar News Agency reported that ruling emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke with Trump about “the current situation in the region and international efforts aimed at de-escalation and strengthening regional security and peace,” without elaborating.

The US has moved the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, ships and warplanes to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement and have the firepower necessary to strike the Islamic Republic should Trump choose to do so.

Already, US forces have shot down a drone they said got too close to the Lincoln and came to the aid of a US-flagged ship that Iranian forces tried to stop in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.

Trump told the news website Axios that he was considering sending a second carrier to the region. “We have an armada that is heading there and another one might be going,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it was “deeply appalled by credible reports detailing the brutal arrest, physical abuse and ongoing life‑threatening mistreatment” of 2023 Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.





The committee that awards the prize said it had information Mohammadi had been beaten during her arrest in December and continued to be mistreated. It called for her immediate and unconditional release.

“She continues to be denied adequate, sustained medical follow‑up while being subjected to heavy interrogation and intimidation,” the committee said. “She has fainted several times, suffers from dangerously high blood pressure and has been prevented from accessing necessary follow‑up for suspected breast tumors.”

Iran just sentenced Mohammadi, 53, to over seven more years in prison. Supporters had warned for months before her arrest that she was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The death toll from a crackdown over Iran’s nationwide protests last month has reached at least 7,002 people killed with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.

Text: Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weisz is  a member of the Council of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.

Nearly two years after October 7, Israel is still at war. There is no clear resolution in sight. As these lines are written, Israel’s Prime Minister is in the United States, having met with President Trump, while public discussion is filled with warnings about the most serious possibilities ahead, including the real danger of a renewed and expanded war with Iran. Stability has not yet returned. Peace has not yet been reached.

In this atmosphere, there is an ongoing debate about “the day after" - what Israel should look like once the war finally ends. Some argue that it is essential to plan now for what comes next. Others insist that it is premature to focus on the aftermath while the war itself is still unfolding.

But there is a basic truth that must not be overlooked: for many people, the day after has already arrived.

For those who were killed al kiddush Hashem, the war is over. For their parents, spouses, and children, life has changed permanently. They are now bereaved parents, widows and orphans. They are not engaged in abstract discussions about future policy or long-term strategy. They are living with a loss that cannot be undone.

Parashat Mishpatim speaks directly to this reality. The Torah does not deal only with historic moments or national decisions. It focuses on daily responsibility - on how Jews are expected to behave in the middle of crisis, especially toward those who are vulnerable and in pain.

The Torah states:

כׇּל־אַלְמָנָה וְיָתוֹם לֹא תְעַנּוּן“You shall not afflict any widow or orphan."(Shemot 22:21)

Rashi explains:

כׇּל אַלְמָנָה וְיָתוֹם לֹא תְעַנּוּן - הוּא הַדִּין לְכָל אָדָם, אֶלָּא שֶׁדִּבֵּר הַכָּתוּב בַּהוֹוֶה, לְפִי שֶׁהֵם תְּשׁוּשֵׁי כֹּחַ וְדָבָר מָצוּי לְעַנּוֹתָם(Rashi to Shemot 22:21, based on the Mechilta)

This means that the prohibition applies to all people, but the Torah singles out widows and orphans because they are weakened and especially vulnerable to being hurt.

The Mechilta adds a crucial point. What defines “affliction" is not what the speaker intended, nor what they believe to be reasonable. The standard is how the other person experiences it.

אִם עַנֵּה תְעַנֶּה אֹתוֹ - אֶחָד עִנּוּי מְרֻבֶּה וְאֶחָד עִנּוּי מוּעָט(Mechilta d’Rabbi Yishmael, Masechta d’Nezikin 18)

Whether the pain caused is great or small, it is still considered affliction.

This teaching is painfully relevant today. Conversations about “the day after" may be necessary and well intentioned. But when such discussions take place in the presence of those already living with loss, they can deepen pain, even when no harm was meant.

The Mechilta records a striking exchange:

כְּבָר הָיָה רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן יוֹצְאִין לֵהָרֵג…אָמַר לוֹ רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל: מִיָּמֶיךָ לֹא בָא אָדָם אֶצְלָךְ לָדִין אוֹ לִשְׁאֵלָה, וְשִׁהִיתּוֹ עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי גּוֹמֵא כּוֹסָךְ, עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי נוֹעֵל סַנְדָּלָךְ, אוֹ עַד שֶׁתְּהֵי עוֹטֵף טַלֵּיתָךְ?וְאָמְרָה הַתּוֹרָה: “אִם עַנֵּה תְעַנֶּה אֹתוֹ."אָמַר לוֹ: נִחַמְתָּנִי רַבִּי.(Mechilta d’Rabbi Yishmael, Nezikin 18)

Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Shimon whether he had ever delayed someone who came to him for judgment or guidance while finishing a drink, tying his shoes, or wrapping his tallit. The Torah teaches that even such a delay can be considered affliction. Rabbi Shimon responded, “You have comforted me, my teacher."

Even actions that seem small or insignificant can cause real pain to someone who is already vulnerable.

The Gemara in Shabbat presents a related story:

רַב יְהוּדָה הֲוָה יָתֵיב קַמֵּיהּ דִּשְׁמוּאֵל… אֲתַאי הַהִיא אִיתְּתָא קָא צָוְוחָה קַמֵּיהּ, וְלָא הֲוָה מַשְׁגַּח בַּהּ.אָמַר לֵיהּ: “אוֹטֵם אָזְנוֹ מִזַּעֲקַת דַּל - גַּם הוּא יִקְרָא וְלֹא יֵעָנֶה."(Shabbat 55a)

A woman cried out before Shmuel, and he did not respond. Rav Yehuda challenged him by quoting the verse: “One who closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself cry and not be answered."

The Gemara does not explicitly rule who was right in that moment. But Tosafot, drawing on a tradition from the Geonim transmitted by Rabbeinu Chananel, offers a striking conclusion based on another Gemara.

The Gemara in Bava Batra teaches:

עוֹלָם הָפוּךְ רָאִיתִי - עֶלְיוֹנִים לְמַטָּה וְתַחְתּוֹנִים לְמַעְלָה(Bava Batra 10b)

“I saw a reversed world - those considered elevated here were lower there, and those considered low here were higher."

Tosafot add:

וּבְאוֹתוֹ עוֹלָם רָאָה שְׁמוּאֵל תַּחַת רַב יְהוּדָה, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוֹכִיחוֹ עַל שֶׁלֹּא הִטָּה אָזְנוֹ לִזְעַקַת הָאִשָּׁה(Tosafot to Bava Batra 10b)

In the World of Truth, Shmuel stood beneath Rav Yehuda, because Rav Yehuda rebuked him for not listening to the woman’s cry.

One moment of moral clarity - seeing and responding to human pain - outweighed years of Torah instruction.

The Gemara further states:

הֲרוּגֵי מַלְכוּת - אֵין כׇּל בְּרִיָּה יְכוֹלָה לַעֲמוֹד בִּמְחִיצָתָן(Pesachim 50a; Bava Batra 10b)

Those killed by the ruling power - no one can stand in their place.

The Rambam rules:

אֵלּוּ הֲרוּגֵי מַלְכוּת - זָכוּ לְחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא בְּלֹא מִצְוֹת מַעֲשִׂיּוֹת(Rambam, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:6)

Those killed by the [foreign] government merit the World to Come even without accumulated mitzvot.

This category includes soldiers and victims of terror who were killed by enemies of Israel.

Parashat Mishpatim reminds us that before political debate, before long-term planning, and before discussions about “the day after," there is a basic mitzvah that cannot be set aside. Not to cause additional pain. Not to ignore those who are crying out. Not to speak over people who are mourning.

We cannot undo what has been lost. We cannot remove the pain. But we are commanded not to add to it.

The Torah does not ask us to predict the future. It asks us to act correctly in the present. While leaders debate strategies and analysts speak about what comes next, Parashat Mishpatim reminds us that the test of a Jewish society is not how it plans for “the day after," but how it treats those for whom that day has already arrived. In times of war and uncertainty, our first obligation is not to explain, justify, or move on - but to listen, to carry responsibility, and to ensure that no additional pain is caused by our words or our silence.

Fox News host Mark Levin heeds warning about the state of Iran, comparing the country to North Korea on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

South Korea's espionage agency, the National Intelligence Service, informed lawmakers Thursday that it thinks North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's teenage daughter is near to being set apart as the regime's future leader, The Associated Press reported.

Kim is the third generation of men in his family to rule North Korea.

In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.

"In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that’s quite significant," Lee noted, according to the outlet.

In 2023, South Korea's National Intelligence Service indicated to lawmakers that the North Korean leader and his wife probably had an older son as well as a younger, third child of unknown gender, according to The Associated Press.

North Korea is one of the world's few nuclear-armed nations, making it a unique threat on the global stage.

A 2025 U.S. Intelligence Community Annual Threat Assessment stated, "Kim remains committed to increasing the number of North Korea’s nuclear warheads and improving its missile capabilities to threaten the Homeland and U.S. forces, citizens, and allies, and to weaken U.S. power in the AsiaPacific region, as evidenced by the pace of the North’s missile flight tests and the regime’s public touting of its uranium enrichment capabilities."

"Russia is increasingly supporting North Korea’s nuclear status in exchange for Pyongyang's support to Moscow’s war against Ukraine," the assessment noted.

Text: At the opening press conference of the Berlin International Film Festival, jury president Wim Wenders avoided taking a stance on Palestinian rights.

The Berlin International Film Festival is no stranger to political controversies, but the first one to hit this year's event happened hours before the Berlinale officially kicked off on February 12 with its opening film, "No Good Men," during a press conference introducing the international jury in the morning.

The conference brought together festival director Tricia Tuttle and the seven people who will be selecting the winners of the Golden and Silver Bears: Jury president Wim Wenders, director of acclaimed films including "Wings of Desire" and the Oscar-nominated "Perfect Days," and his fellow jurors — Nepalese director Min Bahadur; South Korean actor Bae Doona; Indian director, producer and archivist Shivendra Singh Dungarpur; US director, screenwriter and producer Reinaldo Marcus Green; Japanese director, screenwriter and producer HIKARI and Polish producer Ewa Puszczynska.

The livestream of the press conference was interrupted just as political journalist Tilo Jung asked the members of the jury how they felt about the Berlinale's and the German government's stance on Gaza.

Referring to one of the jurors' previous comments on how cinema had the power to change the world, and noting that the festival does not happen in a vacuum, Jung reminded that "the Berlinale as an institution has famously shown solidarity with people in Iran and Ukraine, but never with Palestine, even today."

He went on to ask: "In light of the German government's support of the genocide in Gaza and its role as the main funder of the Berlinale, do you as a member of the jury…"

The livestream was cut off before the host of the podcast "Jung & Naiv" could end his question: "Do you as a member of the jury support this selective treatment of human rights?"

The interruption prompted speculation as to whether the festival had attempted to censor the topic, which organizers promptly denied.

"We had technical problems with the web streaming of the press conference with the international jury this morning," the Berlinale press office said in a statement, in which they also apologized. It adding that the full recording of the press conference would be made available on the festival's website "as soon as possible."

"I find it hard to believe this was just a coincidence," Jung told DW, pointing out that Berlinale director Tricia Tuttle, who was leading the press conference, initially tried to steer away from the topic before some of the jury members offered tense reactions that avoided a direct answer to the question.

"Asking us this question is a little bit unfair," first said Ewa Puszczynska, producer of Holocaust drama "The Zone of Interest." Acknowledging that she had previously talked about how cinema "changes the world," she added, "of course, we are trying to talk to every single viewer, to make them think, but we cannot be responsible for what that decision would be — the decision to support Israel, or the decision to support Palestine."

"But there are many wars with genocides, and we do not talk about that," she continued, adding: "So this is a very complicated question and I think it's a bit unfair asking us what do you think, how we support, not support, talking to our governments or not."


Wim Wenders concluded the discussion on the topic by stating: "We have to stay out of politics because if we make movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics; but we are the counterweight to politics."

"Cinema has an incredible power of being compassionate and empathetic," he also said. "The news is not empathetic. Politics is not empathetic, but movies are. And that's our duty."

The feed remained offline for the entirety of the answers given by Puszczynska and Wenders, but many other news cameras documented the exchange.

Beyond the interruption in the livestream, Jung feels the jury's answers are "questionable."

"A major film festival should not have opened like this," he told DW.

In 2024, Wenders had told press agency dpa on the Berlinale's red carpet that he liked how the festival always took a stance, and that "it would keep on doing so in the future." At the time, the filmmaker was reacting to the festival's decision to disinvite five politicians from the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) from the opening gala.

For the past two years, several filmmakers have made political statements regarding the conflict in Gaza, and the Berlin Film Festival has faced criticism from different sides over how it has handled the sensitive topic.

On the one hand, it is accused of avoiding showing solidarity with Palestinians, and on the other, it has been accused of antisemitism for offering a stage to critical voices.

Criticism of Israel's policies by an Israeli filmmaker were among the 2024 incidents that led to the festival being accused of antisemitism.

Yuval Abraham, the Israeli co-director of the documentary "No Other Land," which portrays the situation in the occupied West Bank, went on to face death threats in his home country following his call at the festival's award ceremony to end "this apartheid, this inequality."

Ahead of the 2025 event — Tricia Tuttle's first year as its director — the festival clarified its position on freedom of expression, including showing solidarity with Palestinians: "All of the guests have a right to free speech within the bounds of the law. We also stand by the right of our filmmakers to talk about the impulses behind their work and their experiences of the world. The Berlinale welcomes different points of view, even if this creates tension or controversy."

"A number of issues were discussed, but in fact, the meeting was focused on the negotiations with Iran. I think that the circumstances he [Trump - TASS] is creating can create the conditions for achieving a good agreement [with Tehran]," Netanyahu stated.

Netanyahu’s remarks, disseminated by his office, mentioned that during the meeting with Trump, the prime minister "expressed general skepticism regarding the nature of any agreement with Iran," but "said that if an agreement is indeed reached, it must include elements that are extremely important for Israel." "This concerns not only the nuclear program. It also concerns ballistic missiles and Iran’s proxies [in the region]," he explained.

The Israeli prime minister added that "Gaza and the entire region" were also touched upon during the conversation.

Text: The world’s largest aircraft carrier has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East, a person familiar with the plans said Thursday, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran.

The move by the USS Gerald R. Ford, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three guided-missile destroyers arrived in the Middle East more than two weeks ago.

It marks a quick turnaround for the USS Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration build up a huge military presence in the leadup to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

It also appears to be at odds with Trump’s national security strategy, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.

Trump on Thursday warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman last week.

“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear program. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”

Trump told Axios earlier this week that he was considering sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East.

Trump held lengthy talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue.

Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.

The USS Ford set out on deployment in late June 2025, which means the crew will have been deployed for eight months in two weeks time.

While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an usually long deployment.

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Text: NEW YORK, February 12. /TASS/. The United States has secretly delivered several thousand Starlink terminals to protesters in Iran, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

According to the report, almost 6,000 terminals were illegally sent through the Iranian border. Over the past few months, the US Department of State has purchased approximately 7,000 Starlink terminals, most of them in January.

US President Donald Trump was informed of the move, but it is unclear whether he directly authorized it.

In January, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk's SpaceX had cancelled the fee needed to access Starlink infrastructure in Iran.

Unrest in Iran began on December 29 after street protests triggered by a sharp fall in the Iranian rial exchange rate, and spread to most major cities. Authorities reported the deaths of 40 law enforcement officers. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, armed terrorists appeared among the demonstrators on January 8. Iranian authorities blamed Israel and the United States for organizing the unrest. On January 23, Araghchi said that the death toll from the riots had reached 3,117, with both civilians and security officers among the victims. Washington warned that it was considering the use of force against the Islamic Republic.

UNITED NATIONS: Iran’s election as vice-chair of the United Nations Commission for Social Development is being slammed by human rights advocates and policy analysts, who have condemned the U.N.'s hypocrisy when it comes to its treatment of undemocratic regimes.

The leadership role was approved without objection during a meeting of the commission, where delegates adopted agenda items and organizational decisions by consensus.

The United Nations has faced continued criticism over its inaction towards the regime's violent crackdown against protesters in December and January. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres faced criticism for congratulating Iran on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

UN CHIEF BLASTED AS ‘ABJECTLY TONE-DEAF’ OVER MESSAGE TO IRAN MARKING REVOLUTION ANNIVERSARY


U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz criticized the development, writing on X: "Yet another reason why we are not a member of, nor do we participate in, this ridiculous ‘Commission for Social Development.’"

Alireza Jafarzadeh, author of The Iran Threat and deputy director of the U.S. office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, also criticized the decision. "Having the Iranian regime in the leadership of a U.N. body tasked with promoting democracy, gender equality, tolerance and non-violence is appalling and like fox guarding the hen house," Jafarzadeh said. "The vast majority of the Iranian people are calling for regime change because the mullahs are the world’s leading human rights violators, misogynist to the core, and they slaughter the voices of dissent by thousands."

He argued that Iran should face scrutiny rather than institutional advancement. "Instead, the Iranian regime must be a subject of intense investigation and accountability by all U.N. bodies for crimes against humanity and genocide, from the 1980s to January 2026 uprisings," Jafarzadeh said. "Decades of inaction by Western governments have emboldened the regime. This must stop now."

"By electing Iran to help lead a commission devoted to democracy, women’s rights and non-violence, the U.N. makes itself into a mockery," said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. "This is a regime that brutalizes women for not covering their hair, and that just massacred tens of thousands of its own civilians in two days."

Neuer argued that governments had the ability to block the appointment but chose not to act. "The EU states know how to stop abusive regimes from winning these seats — they’ve done so in the recent past with Russia — but this time on Iran, they chose silence and complicity," he said. "By rewarding the Mullahs right after their slaughter of innocents, the U.N. has now sent a very dangerous message to Tehran."

Lisa Daftari, an Iran analyst, said the optics of Iran holding a leadership role in a commission centered on social development and rights were deeply troubling.



"For Iranian women who risk prison or worse just for taking off a headscarf, watching Tehran get a vice-chair on a U.N. social-development commission feels like a slap in the face."

She added that broader patterns in U.N. voting and resolutions contribute to perceptions of bias.

"When the same U.N. system has spent the last decade passing roughly 170-plus resolutions against Israel and only around 80 on all other countries combined, you don’t need a PhD to see there’s a bias problem," Daftari said. "When the U.N. has churned out well over a hundred anti-Israel resolutions in recent years while managing a fraction of that number on the world’s worst dictatorships, it looks less like moral leadership and more like political theater."

Daftari rejected that procedural nature of United Nations committees and committees.

"Some diplomats will wave this away as a procedural formality, but at the U.N. nothing is ever purely symbolic," she said. "The bottom line is that handing Iran’s regime a gavel on ‘social development’ confirms yet again that the place is biased and deeply hypocritical."

Text: Africa's heads of state are gathering in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for their annual meeting this weekend at a time when the continent's place in the world appears to be in flux.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking in Davos last month, described an arresting image of the future of international relations: either countries were at the table or they were on the menu.

For Africa's leaders, who for years have been arguing that they should be dining at the top table, it was not an unfamiliar analogy.

But in his second term, US President Donald Trump has accelerated the trend towards great-power domination of world affairs and the ditching of multilateralism.

As the White House's updated security strategy says, not every region in the world can get equal attention. Trump's pivot towards the Western hemisphere, as well as time spent on the Middle East, has implied less focus on Africa.

The less powerful nations, who may have once relied on the norms, as well as the finance, of global bodies such as the UN, World Bank or World Trade Organization, are now having to re-evaluate relationships.

These moves have given fresh urgency to the question of how the continent should deal with the rest of the world.

For Tighisti Amare, director of the Africa programme at the UK-based Chatham House think-tank, there is a danger that African countries will be "left behind" if they fail to develop an effective common strategy.

But already, for the US, there is a menu full of tempting bilateral deals involving minerals and natural resources, which bypass any opportunity for collective bargaining on the part of the continent.

When it comes to Africa, the policy shift reflected in pronouncements from Washington is dizzying.

A little over three years ago, then-President Joe Biden told the continent's leaders at a summit in the US capital, that "the United States is all-in on Africa's future".

This followed a White House strategy document on sub-Saharan Africa which described the region as "critical to advancing our global priorities".

Critics, however, have questioned whether this really did penetrate the Oval Office, with Biden's only visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president - to Cape Verde, briefly, and Angola - coming in the last full month of his term.

In contrast to the official statements from his predecessor, Trump's America First approach has a much narrower idea of US interests.

"We cannot afford to be equally attentive to every region and every problem in the world," the White House's National Security Strategy stated last November.

The three paragraphs on Africa at the end spoke about partnering with "select countries to ameliorate conflict, foster mutually beneficial trade relationships" and move from supplying aid to encouraging investment and economic growth.

For Peter Pham, who was a special envoy to Africa during Trump's first administration, this is a more honest approach.

"I was trained in the realist school of international relations," he told the BBC, "and I'm not delusional enough to think that Africa is front and centre of US interests as much as it's maybe front and centre of my life.

"There's no way any country, even a superpower, can be all things to everyone. The reality is we don't have the bandwidth nor the resources, as generous as the American people have been, to do everything for everyone.

"So we have to husband those resources and steward them as best we can to achieve the optimal outcome for obviously our own citizens, but also our partners writ large."

One of the clearest expressions of this was the minerals deal that the US struck with the Democratic Republic of Congo in December, which happened in tandem with the signing of a peace deal with Rwanda.

It was aimed at "building secure, reliable and durable supply chains for critical minerals" for the US, according to the text, as well as encouraging investment in DR Congo, which has huge reserves of minerals essential for the manufacture of electronic goods.

Pham himself is part of another deal as he is chairman of Ivanhoe Atlantic a company involved in the development of the "Liberty Corridor", a project building new infrastructure linking Guinea's vast iron ore mines to a Liberian port to boost exports of the raw material.

Ken Opalo, an Africa specialist at Georgetown University's school of foreign service in Washington, is worried that the US's transactional, bilateral approach "means that the bargaining position for African countries will be terribly weak and therefore they may not get the best deals possible".

He told the BBC that if "the DR Congo example is anything to go by, the US focus on minerals is about merely securing mining rights for American companies and little else in terms of the broader economic co-operation, which is not what the region needs.

"The region needs deeper market access, investment treaties and the ability to attract US capital for all sectors not just mining."

DR Congo's Mines Minister Louis Watum Kabamba dismissed these concerns. Speaking at a mining summit in Cape Town this week, he said his country was not going to "sell everything for nothing to America".

Of course, the US is not the only big power involved. China, for more than a decade, outspent the US in terms of foreign direct investment in Africa, though this position was reversed last year.

Other countries, such as Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are also striking their own investment and security deals.

The transactional approach is not necessarily bad, Opalo said, but he argued that there is not the strategic depth of thinking going on, or diplomatic expertise, in African governments "to play this game well". This means leaders may go for easy wins without considering the long-term implications, he feared.

On the security front, Africa's failure to resolve the civil war in Sudan, triggering what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis, could be seen as an example of this, Opalo added.

Despite its officially neutral stance, Turkey has been accused of supplying the Sudanese army with weapons. Iran and Russia also face the same accusation. All have been met with denials, but last February Russia signed a deal with Sudan's military government to set up a naval base in the country.

On the other side, the UAE has been accused of backing the Rapid Support Forces, which it also denies.

"The failure to sort Sudan out is symptomatic of the lack of agency that the continent has," Opalo said.

Ghana's President John Mahama, for one, is trying to shift this assessment.

Mahama, like Carney, also spoke at the Swiss ski resort Davos.

He said that with "an unpredictable ally across the Atlantic" and shrinking development assistance, the world was at an "inflexion point".

"Africa must pull itself up by its own bootstraps," he argued.

In a passionate address he declared that the continent had lost its sovereignty and was caught in a dependency trap. This was true both in areas of aid spending - such as health and education - as well as security matters, he said, adding that when it comes to natural resources, "we supply the world's critical minerals but capture almost none of the value".

The president's prescription, through his Accra Reset project, is more investment in relevant skills, co-ordinated industrialisation across Africa's regions and joined-up continental negotiation with outside partners.

But these are calls that have been heard before and the question is whether there is a greater chance now that something will change.

For analyst Tighisti the "key challenge is that to create a united front, leaders should be more focused on regional interests. Sometimes this means that national interests have to be put aside if they really want agency in international negotiations."

In his Davos speech, the Canadian prime minister called for the world's "middle powers" to act together. In Africa these could include Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa.

But Tighisti said that while "these are the countries that everyone is looking up to, there is a lack of continental leadership to really push the integration agenda".

One key problem is that many leaders are very inward-facing, as "they themselves have huge domestic challenges that they need to address at the same time".

She added that there was already the framework for countries to work more closely through things such as the continent's free trade area - a project aimed at boosting commerce between African countries  - and the African Union's Agenda 2063, described as a master plan for transforming the continent, but progress on these has been slow.

Laying out his pitch in Switzerland, Mahama said that "Africa intends to be at the table in determining what that new global order will look like".

But there is still a lot of work to do to get the most out of the shift in US foreign policy as well as the continent's other partners – the dinner invitations are not yet being sent out.

German director Wim Wenders said on Thursday filmmakers must stay out of politics and focus on changing how people think, at the ‌start of the Berlin Film Festival.

Considered more politically minded than its counterparts in Venice and Cannes, the festival has been repeatedly criticized by pro-Palestinian activists for not taking an overt stance on Gaza, in contrast ‌to the war in Ukraine and the situation in Iran.

Asked for ⁠his view on the German government's position on Gaza, Wenders said: "We ⁠have to stay out ⁠of politics because if we made movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the ‌field of politics, but we are the counterweight to politics."

Germany's response to the Gaza war has ⁠been criticized as overly cautious, mostly owing ⁠to an enduring sense of guilt for the Nazi Holocaust.

Speaking to journalists at the festival, where he is head of this year's seven-member international jury, the 80-year-old said: "We have to do the work of people and not the work of ⁠politicians."

The livestream of the press conference cut out shortly after the question on Gaza, ⁠prompting the journalist who asked it to ‌accuse the festival of censorship.

Organizers issued an apology for what they said were technical problems and said they would make the full recording available online.

Wenders, whose film career spans from "Wings of Desire" four decades ago to 2023's "Perfect Days", said ‌being on the jury in Berlin was a unique experience.

"Because in Berlin, you can be sure you see more facets of the world than in any other festival. And that's the great strength of the Berlinale," said Wenders.

Organizers have repeatedly faced questions on Gaza and calls for a boycott by pro-Palestinian groups. In turn, the closing ceremony in 2024 drew criticism from German politicians after several winners expressed solidarity with the Palestinians and criticized Israel's ​actions after the October 7, 2023 attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

"Movies can change the world. Not in a political way. No movie has really changed ‌any politician's idea. But we can change .. the idea that people have of how they should live," the veteran director said.

The festival begins on Thursday evening with the opening film "No Good Men" and culminates with the ‌closing ceremony on February 21, when Wenders and his jury will award the Golden ⁠Bear top prize to one of ⁠a total of 22 films in competition.

Four ​members of this year's jury are from Asia: Min Bahadur Bham, who directed ⁠the festival's first Nepalese competition ‌film, "Shambhala"; South Korean actor Bae Doona; Indian director, producer and archivist ​Shivendra Singh Dungarpur; and Hikari, who recently directed Japan-set drama "Rental Family."

U.S. director Reinaldo Marcus Green, whose biographical sports drama "King Richard" earned six Oscar nominations, and renowned Polish producer Ewa Puszczynska, round out the jury.





Wenders is the type of artist we saw in the Weimar Republic who watched, arms folded, the resistible rise of the Austrian corporal from his ivory tower:

"Movies can change the world. Not in a political way. No movie has really changed ‌any politician's idea. But we can change .. the idea that people have of how they should live,"

Hmm. OK, this is the usual cop-out of a careerist filmmaker who knows on which side his "Brot" is buttered in a business where pro-Palestinian views can silence your phone.

Germany's response to the Gaza war has ⁠been criticized as overly cautious, mostly owing ⁠to an enduring sense of guilt for the Nazi Holocaust.

Hmm, it's not "Germany", not the majority of Germans, but the tiny group of people who call themselves the "government" who are actively supporting with weapons and political and diplomatic cover the mass-killing of civilians in the Gaza "Ghetto" and the West Bank, which makes them yet again guilty of their third G. in just over a hundred years. And anyone, including Jews, who, unlike Wenders, dares to protest in public will be pummelled and arrested by a militarized police no less brutal in their MO than the braunshirts were.

Text: Alex Traiman is the CEO and Jerusalem bureau chief of the Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) and host of “Jerusalem Minute." A seasoned Israeli journalist, documentary filmmaker and startup consultant, he is an expert on Israeli politics and U.S.-Israel relations. A former NCAA champion fencer and Yeshiva University Sports Hall of Fame member, he made aliyah in 2004, and lives in Jerusalem with his wife and five children.

(JNS) On the face of it, it may appear that the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t go as well as the latter may have hoped.

Netanyahu was not greeted at the West Wing entrance by Trump in front of waiting cameras, as he had been before. There were no pre-meeting or post-meeting press opportunities. Typically, such pressers are loaded with big grins and mutual platitudes, in addition to substance.

And it’s hard to know whether the three-hour meeting, which went much longer than planned, was filled with consensus. Yet with these two leaders, public appearances may be intentional projections designed to camouflage future intentions.

While no details were released as to what took place, there was much on the table to discuss. Netanyahu reportedly shared Israeli intelligence regarding Iranian nuclear development, ballistic-missile production and the massacre of Iranian protesters-all designed to demonstrate that Iran is violating each and every one of America and Israel’s collective red lines.

Focusing on the nuclear program

Yet Trump continues to insist on negotiating with the Islamic Republic and centering negotiations on its nuclear program. In a post on Truth Social immediately following his meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump wrote: “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a deal can be consummated. If it can, I let the prime minister know that will be a preference."

From one point of view, it is difficult to understand why Trump would enter any negotiations at this point, barely six months after Jerusalem and Washington used 12 days of penetrating air power to destroy Iran’s known nuclear facilities.

Just six weeks ago, during the last Trump-Netanyahu meeting in Mar-a-Lago, Trump told reporters that the United States would act quickly with military force if it could be proven that Tehran was attempting to restart its nuclear program.

Furthermore, Trump announced weeks ago to protesters being mowed down in the streets in the tens of thousands by the Islamic regime’s brutal forces that “help is on the way." Many assumed that help would come in the form of forthcoming military intervention.

The president has since paused referring to Iranian citizens, and instead has been focusing his comments squarely on Iran’s nuclear program and ballistic missiles, insisting that a negotiated settlement is his preferred course of action.

The art of a nuclear deal

Trump, a master negotiator and author of the best-seller, The Art of the Deal, is well aware of what a good deal or a bad deal looks like.

In May 2018, during his first administration, he withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal-officially the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that former President Barack Obama signed in 2015. Trump recently called that one of the “worst deals" ever brokered.

Trump is intrinsically aware that Iran’s goal in negotiating is to stall and try to strengthen its dramatically weakened strategic and even military position. Still, any deal the present regime enters would not be worth the paper it’s printed on.

Iran is a signatory to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. That didn’t prevent it from developing a sophisticated illicit nuclear-weapons program.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Netanyahu appear to be on the same page about what successful negotiations in 2026 must guarantee: no nuclear enrichment or weaponization; strict limits on ballistic missiles; no funding of foreign terror proxies in the Middle East or beyond; and no mass murder of Iranian protesters.

Maximum leverage

Trump is banking that by applying maximum leverage on the Islamic Republic, he can extract maximum concessions. Trump has mobilized a “massive armada" that sits as a sword of Damocles over Iran’s head. And he has demonstrated that under his leadership, the United States is no paper tiger and not afraid to strike in Iran at nuclear facilities or senior leaders.

Back in January 2020, Trump ordered the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Baghdad. The strike reportedly shook Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the core. Less than a year ago, Trump pleaded with Iran, without success, to negotiate its nuclear program.

In his post on Truth Social immediately following his meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Trump wrote: “Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a deal, and they were hit with ‘Midnight Hammer.’ That did not work well for them. Hopefully, this time they will be more reasonable and responsible."

Trump’s Achilles’ heel

Yet by entering any deal, Iran’s goal will be to buy time to live another day, wait out the Trump presidency, and ultimately, take advantage of the West after a new president is in office.

From Israel’s perspective, this is the major Achilles’ heel of the U.S. president’s Middle East policy.

Acting benevolently toward malign actors, such as Syria’s Ahmed Al-Sharaa and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, may yield short-term benefits and relative calm for Washington. Trump should genuinely be trusted when he tells Netanyahu that he will personally intervene if Erdoğan threatens Israel’s security.

The problem is that, unlike Middle Eastern dictators, many of whom reign for decades, Trump has barely three years remaining in office.

There is a strong chance that any future president, like so many of Trump’s predecessors, will be significantly more likely to be taken advantage of by despots. This is particularly true if the next president is a left-wing progressive or a right-wing isolationist.

Further, if the political pendulum swings in the next presidential election, there are no guarantees that a future president would not outright cancel any deal that Trump reaches, just as Trump withdrew from Obama’s JCPOA.

The ultimate deal: Exile of Khamenei

Trump may now be trying to broker the ultimate deal, including guarantees that Iran would meet America’s requirements to cease any nuclear enrichment, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and state sponsorship of terror proxies.

In reality, the only negotiated outcome that could be trusted to achieve these results would be the exile of Khamenei, the mullahs and other upper echelons of his regime.

When longtime Syrian President Bashar Assad lost control of his military forces and his country, he chose to live in exile rather than be killed and fled to Moscow. Trump reportedly offered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro an exile off-ramp to Turkey that he refused before he was arrested on Jan. 3 by U.S. forces.

For Khamenei to accept exile, he would need to recognize that his rule would soon end by force if he refused to go. Yet that strategy assumes that at the end of the day, the 86-year-old theocrat is a rational actor.

Khamenei is neither a president nor a king. He is an ayatollah, guided by a fundamentalist and messianic ideology, who has demonstrated his willingness to wreak havoc across the Middle East. Accordingly, one must gauge that he may strike with every weapon at his disposal toward every viable target, even if his capabilities pale in comparison to the military capabilities of America or Israel.

Striking Iran would likely set off a series of retaliations across the region, potentially jump-starting a larger war. And that could pull the United States into it, too. Under the “Declarations of War Act," an extended military campaign could require congressional approval, a process Trump would prefer to avoid. By contrast, congressional approval is not necessarily required for isolated, targeted operations like “Midnight Hammer" to bomb the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear complexes, or “Operation Absolute Resolve" to remove Maduro.

‘Up to the Iranian people’

It has been reported that Trump would prefer not to be associated with assassinating Khamenei, even though Iran allegedly attempted to assassinate Trump.

Speaking to reporters this week, Vance stated, “If the Iranian people want to overthrow the regime, that’s up to the Iranian people."

Coming off a successful special forces operation to remove Maduro from Venezuela barely one month ago, and with Cuba now teetering on the brink of collapse, Trump would prefer that any regime change in Iran occur without American military intervention.

The president does not want to cement a reputation of foisting regime changes by force around the world, as bad and as anti-American as these regimes may be. Instead, he seeks to use his own skills to out-negotiate a people known for their own prowess at the negotiation table.

In 2020, Trump posted on X that “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!"

Vance said this week that “the president has told his entire senior team that we should be trying to cut a deal that ensures the Iranians don’t have a nuclear weapon. But if we can’t cut that deal, then there’s another option on the table. The president is going to continue to preserve his options."

Netanyahu’s longtime strategy

The Israeli prime minister himself is a master strategist who has managed a seven-front war, alongside diplomatic and domestic challenges, with wisdom, temerity and resolve. In the past year, he has outflanked his adversary Khamenei and worked exceptionally well with Trump, his friend and ally. As a result, Iran’s entire terror proxy network has been weakened; its ballistic-missile stockpile and launching capabilities have been reduced to less than half of their original strength; and its nuclear program is in a shambles.

Before last June and Israel’s 12-day war, Trump used the threat of Israeli military action as his leverage in failed attempts to negotiate the end to Iran’s nuclear program. He was only to hold Israel off for so long before Netanyahu ordered the Israel Air Force to take matters into their own hands and strike at Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.

Once again, Netanyahu reportedly seeks to maintain the freedom of Israeli operations against Iran, regardless of whether Trump signs any negotiated deal. An American document need not bind Israel.

So while on the outset, it may appear that he did not achieve what he had hoped-to immediately convince Trump that negotiations with Iran are doomed to fail-the likelihood that Trump will enter a bad deal remains slim.

With this meeting, Trump is fully aware of Israel’s position. He is also fully aware of what a Middle East without fundamentalist ayatollahs will mean for the entire region and the world.

Similarly, as they did just before the 12-day war last June, Trump and Netanyahu may have agreed on a set timetable for negotiations, after which a military option can be initiated. Iran is likely now on the clock to make a deal.

No one knows right now if Trump’s statements represent the actual outcome of the meeting. It wouldn’t be the first time that Trump and Netanyahu have used misdirection to foil Khamenei. It was obviously strategic that the two leaders opted not to speak to the press during or after their conversation.

Yet even if this meeting did not set the terms and target for a joint U.S.-Israel war with Iran, it remains almost certain that the next one will.

Text: WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that Iran would face a “very traumatic” moment if it doesn’t make a deal with the US within the next month.

“We have to make a deal, otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic, very traumatic,” Trump told reporters at the White House — one day after meeting privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“They should have made a deal the first time. They got Midnight Hammer instead, and this will be very traumatic for Iran.”

Asked about his timeline for an agreement to be reached, Trump answered: “I guess over the next month, something like that.”

“They should agree very quickly,” the president added.

“I’ll talk to them as long as I like, and we’ll see if we can get a deal with them. And if we can’t, we’ll have to go to phase two,” he went on.

“Phase two will be very tough for them. I’m not looking for that.”

The rough one-month timeframe can’t necessarily be taken at face value.Trump’s attack on three Iranian nuclear sites this past June featured deception about timing — with the White House saying he would decide what to do “within the next two weeks.”





Just two days later, the bombs fell.

Trump’s latest ramp-up to a possible attack began with a warning on Jan. 2 that the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go” if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” which it reportedly then did on a historic scale.

Trump on Jan. 13 called on protesters to “TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” and said “HELP IS ON ITS WAY” — before backing away from an immediate strike, citing Iran’s decision to postpone executions of hundreds of demonstrators.

Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday in Oman to discuss a deal that would address the country’s nuclear program and support for regional terror proxies.

The president recently ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and a supporting strike group into the Arabian Sea and reportedly is considering moving a second carrier, the USS George H.W. Bush, to the region.

Text: Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference this week

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation this week to the Munich Security Conference where increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump’s often inconsistent policies and threats that have roiled transatlantic relations and the post-World War II international order.

A year after Vice President JD Vance stunned assembled dignitaries at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America’s closest allies in Europe, accusing them of imperiling Western civilization with left-leaning domestic programs and not taking responsibility for their own defense, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering of world leaders and national security officials Saturday, U.S. officials say.

The State Department’s formal announcement of Rubio’s trip offered no details about his two-day stop in Munich, after which he will visit Slovakia and Hungary. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the trip, said America's top diplomat intends to focus on areas of cooperation on shared global and regional concerns, including in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as China, an economic powerhouse seeking to take advantage of the uncertainty in U.S.-European ties.

Should that be the case, many in the audience may be relieved after being buffeted first by Vance’s blunt rebukes last year and then a series of Trump statements and moves in the months since that have targeted virtually every country in Europe, Canada and long-standing allies in the Indo-Pacific.

Trump’s recent comments about taking control of Greenland from NATO member Denmark and insults hurled at various leaders were particularly unnerving, leading many in Europe to question the value of the U.S. as an ally and partner.

That leaves Rubio with a heavy lift if he wants to calm the waters.

Vance's speech last year was “really a shock moment,” said Claudia Major, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “It was perceived as the first very clear statement of what the new Trump administration was about," namely that “Europeans are not partners any longer.”

“There is a big doubt whether the basis (of trust) is still there and whether we still share the same vision for the trans-Atlantic relationship,” she said. “The longer this kind of estrangement goes, the more difficult it will be to re-find a solid relationship.”

Munich Security Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger offered a similar view.

“Transatlantic relations are currently in a significant crisis of confidence and credibility,” he said this week. But he also expressed hope that Rubio and the dozens of U.S. lawmakers expected to attend the meeting will offer a less dire and dour prognosis for the future.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whom Rubio will meet Friday, has tried to adopt a middle line to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and insistence on transactional relations.

He said Europe also needs to “learn the language of power politics” to assert itself, for example, by taking greater responsibility for its security, striving for greater “technological independence” and boosting its economic growth. But he stressed that “as democracies, we are partners and allies and not subordinates” of the U.S.

Some, like French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, appear to have all but given up on Trump and the United States. Both Canada and France opened consulates in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, last week in a show of support for both Greenland and Denmark.

Macron warned this week that tensions between Europe and the U.S. could intensify after the recent “Greenland moment.” He described the Trump administration as “openly anti-European” and seeking the European Union’s “dismemberment."

“When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” he said in an interview with several European newspapers. “I think we’ve tried that strategy for months. It’s not working.”

Macron noted a “double crisis: We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side.”

Carney — who drew applause from many for pushing back against Trump in a speech last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland — has made no secret of his frustration and impatience with the Republican president.

Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. He vowed to pursue trade deals with countries other than the U.S., including China, to serve as anchors of commercial stability. The China deal drew new threats from Trump.

For many in Europe, Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland exacerbate their fears over Russia’s war with Ukraine and serve as a reminder of centuries of power politics in which diplomacy was subordinate to the use of military force.

“Greenland is to Trump as, essentially, Ukraine is to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, although obviously without the devastating war at this stage,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term in office.

In the meantime, as Trump tries to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and seek a nuclear deal with Iran, Europeans are increasingly uneasy about Trump’s “Board of Peace,” a 27-member group of world leaders tasked first with handling the Gaza peace agreement but eventually envisaged as a vehicle for resolving other major conflicts.

Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden, among others, have either declined to accept or have not yet signed on to the board, which will hold its first meeting to raise money for Gaza in Washington on Feb. 19.

Text: Iran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.

This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.

The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.

Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.

Trump said the strikes had "obliterated" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials "were thinking about starting a new site".

Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.

A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.

A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.

At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.

Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.

ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.

"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment," they said.

Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.

At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal.

Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would "help dampen" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside.

Also at Isfahan nuclear site, a new roof has been constructed. The building, attacked in an Israeli strike last year, is thought have been used in the manufacture of centrifuges.

Above-ground work is also visible at Natanz nuclear facility at a location damaged in air strikes by both Israel and the US last June. Between early December and January a roof has been built over a damaged anti-drone cage at an enrichment plant.

ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.

Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is "operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can".

"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed," he added. "Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything."

Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.

"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment," he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.

He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.

A potential restructure would affect sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield, a union says.

The expiration of New START means there are no limits on nuclear weapons between both countries for the first time since 1991.

Channels of communication were suspended in 2021 shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.


Tehran says its armed forces are ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression.

Text: MOSCOW, February 12. /TASS/. Moscow and Yerevan will begin negotiations on restoring two Armenian railway segments linking the country to Azerbaijan and Turkey, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk told reporters.

"In accordance with the address of the Armenian side and proceeding from friendly fraternal feelings to the people of Armenia, the Russian Federation made the decision to start specific talks on restoring two segments of Armenian railways that will provide for their joining with railways of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Eraskh area and with railways of the Republic of Turkey in Akhuryan settlement area," Overchuk said.

The total length of railway segments to be restored is about 1.6 km and 12.4 km, the deputy prime minister said. Technical, financial and other modalities for implementation of this project are expected to be determined during talks. "We high value the confidence in Russian experience, competencies and technologies that was demonstrated by the Armenian side when approaching Russia," Overchuk noted. "Restoration of these segments will provide the Russian Federation with the possibility of the direct railway communication with the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan and Turkey with the access to Mediterranean ports and Iran with access to ports of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean," he added.

The work is underway for solving this major task to unblock all disrupted routes in the Caucasus, including an opportunity being considered to restore the rail traffic between Russia and Georgia via the territory of Abkhazia, Overchuk noted. "Strengthening of transport and logistical connectivity in the Caucasus is of critical importance for peace, stability and economic prosperity of the peoples of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Turkey and Russia. We expect constructive interaction of all the countries of the region in solving this important common task," he added.

A couple of weeks ago, I interviewed India's Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri at Energy Week in Goa, India. I was probing, trying to get a former diplomat of 50 years to give me a straight answer on why a U.S.-India trade deal was proving so elusive.

"I'm not trying to dodge you," said Puri, repeating once again that discussions were "at a very advanced stage."

Six days later, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a truce.

On Feb. 2, Trump removed the 25% additional penalty imposed for buying Russian oil, claiming that India had committed to stop these purchases. This claim wasn't reiterated by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his post on X, however, and nor was it mentioned in the joint statement issued by the two nations.

But it marked a much-needed reset.

The relationship had hit a low point, said Vasuki Shastry, a senior advisor to geostrategic advisory firm Gatehouse. "They're trying to desperately reset. India wants stability, the U.S. doesn't want to lose India. This is the halfway house solution, the off-ramp for both."

In all the months since Trump shocked India by imposing the penalty for purchasing Russian oil, the nation didn't stop buying, nor did it say it would.

India imports 85-90% of its crude oil. Pre-Covid, India wasn't importing much from Russia, but the purchases ramped up nearly 40% following the Ukraine war, primarily due to the discount on offer.

Post Trump's 25% penalty, particularly in the past two months, that number has been inching downwards toward the 20% mark, according to data and analytics firm Kpler.

In the nine days since Trump's claim, neither India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal nor the Foreign Ministry has confirmed it. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said India's energy policy would be determined as always by availability and pricing considerations.

Shastry told me that energy is a national security issue and the Foreign Ministry statement was "absolutely on target."

And then came another reveal: the U.S. revising its fact sheet on the trade deal.

It removed "pulses" from a list of products it said India would reduce or remove tariffs on, and replaced the word "committed" to say that India "intends" to make $500 billion worth of purchases from the U.S. over five years in the agreement.

Talk about collaborative narrative management.

It's this audacity of opacity — that a straight answer isn't needed — that has seen observers suggest this is a decision to remain "strategically ambiguous."

"This is the best way for India," said the former Indian trade negotiator and founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, Ajay Srivastava.

Shastry goes one step further. He believes India and the U.S. have together made the trade-off: let us be labelled opaque rather than losing face.

"There was an urgency in Washington since India concluded the mother of all deals [with the EU]. The real question is what is the actual understanding between the U.S. and India," he said.

It's notable that India and the U.S. have only struck an interim deal so far. The negotiations for the full bilateral trade agreement are yet to be completed. Goyal told Indian reporters: "A formal agreement on this deal will take 30-45 days and will be signed in March."

It's unclear, however, what India's silence on buying Russian oil means for these negotiations. Will it be the elephant in the room with the potential to crush the negotiating table?

"There must be some understanding on this, an internal decision that is not being conveyed," Srivastava said.

The possibility of backchannel talks with Russia also cannot be dismissed. India's historic dependence on Russia for its defence needs cannot be overstated.

Shortly after Trump's executive order that India had "committed to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil," the Kremlin's spokesperson chimed in to say, "we haven't heard any statements from Delhi on this matter yet."

It brought to mind the famous quote by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill about Russia: "a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma."

So can Russia ever be counted out?

"I don't see India stopping to buy Russian oil," said Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler. "Flows will continue, but we won't see a level of 2 million barrels per day, or 40%. It will slowly move from the 20% or so it is now to 15% and I don't see it going lower than that."

He argues that the Indian refiner Nayara Energy, in particular, will continue buying Russian oil. It is majority-owned by Russian entities, including the U.S.-sanctioned Rosneft.

For now, the markets are happy there is a deal, says Vivek Sharma, head of international business at Nuvama Asset Services & Nuvama Private. "The politics might be consuming the narrative, but it'll die down. India's been smart to remain ambiguous, remaining aligned with the U.S., without jeopardising its relationship with Russia."

Sharma said that as the cost of oil is likely to keep falling or remain low, India will be able to reduce its share of Russian oil — all while saying it is following market forces rather than a U.S. diktat.

Kpler's Ritolia believes the decline in India's Russian oil purchases won't have much of an impact on its import bill or global oil prices because a "trade shuffle" will occur."China will buy that Russian oil which India won't, and for that it will have to let go of some other market, maybe The Middle East, which India would buy from. The Dubai pricing complex will get a bit of a premium."The larger concern for the oil market, analysts say, is the possibility of a U.S. and Iran conflict.

Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra, talks about India's AI ambitions and explores the options for labor and language in the country. He says India will continue to be an AI talent factory.

Feroze Azeez of Anand Rathi weighs in on India's equity fund flows. According to industry data, Gold ETFs attracted more money than equities. Azeez says many HNIs chased a metals rally and fell for a "FOMO trap."

Aberdeen's James Thom says India's U.S. trade deal lifts a key overhang, improving sentiment after months of underperformance. He sees easier liquidity, stable policy and stronger earnings supporting a market recovery.

India's central bank on Friday kept its policy rates steady, as trade deals with the E.U. and the U.S. are set to support the world's fastest-growing large economy. "Successful completion of trade deals augurs well" for overall economic outlook, said Sanjay Malhotra, governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

New Delhi is ready to place orders worth up to $80 billion for Boeing planes, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said, signaling the country's willingness to expand trade with the U.S.

I think the government has done well to protect the import of soybean and maize, because these are the two commodities which the U.S. was exporting to China in very large quantity.

— Siraj Hussain, former agriculture secretary of India

Indian stocks slid amid mixed trading in the region on Thursday. The Nifty 50 declined 0.4%, breaking a four-session winning streak. The index is down more than 1% so far this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked up slightly to around 6.709%.

The rupee strengthened 0.16% to 90.58 against the dollar. The currency has weakened around 0.8% against the greenback since the start of the year.

BERLIN/MUNICH, Feb 13 - One year after U.S. Vice President JD Vance attacked European allies at the Munich Security Conference, Washington's partners will be seeking to chart a more independent course, while preserving the basis of the alliance.

Vance's 2025 speech at the annual gathering of top security officials triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic confrontation, with the United States seemingly set on dismantling much of the international order it helped to build.

This year's meeting, which begins on Friday, also comes against a backdrop of multiple conflicts, including war in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.

"I cannot remember a time when we had more simultaneous wars, crises, and conflicts of that dimension," Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the forum, told a gathering earlier this week.

'WRECKING-BALL POLITICS' THREATEN ALLIANCE

Transatlantic ties have long been central to the Munich Security Conference, which began as a Cold War forum for Western defence debate. But the unquestioned assumption of transatlantic cooperation that underpinned it has been upended by what Ischinger called "wrecking-ball politics" in which "sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day."

U.S. President Donald Trump has toppled Venezuela’s leader, threatened other Latin American countries with similar military action, imposed tariffs on friends and foes alike and talked openly about annexing Greenland - a move that could effectively end the NATO alliance.

Last year's speech by Vance at the conference, accusing European leaders of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration, marked a key milestone in the deterioration of relations.

The Trump administration's harsh new tone, including a dire warning that Europe faces "civilisational erasure", has shaken its allies, which have pledged to step up spending on their militaries after decades of neglect.

But Europe's dependence on U.S. military support will take years to undo, leaving Europe vulnerable as the standoff with Russia over the Ukraine war persists.

"In recent weeks and months, perhaps for the first time in a long while, we have been able to see with our own eyes that we can be a power — especially on the basis of the values we are not willing to abandon," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told parliament late last month, referring to Europe's pushback against Trump over Greenland.

"We have been able to feel something of the happiness that comes from self-respect," he said, noting, however, the EU would need to do more to assure its own security and economic competitiveness to be able to assert itself.

Vance's absence this year has led to expectations of a less confrontational tone from Washington.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading the U.S. delegation and is expected to strike a more conciliatory stance in a speech expected on Saturday, Ischinger said.

A RECORD TALLY OF LEADERS

Merz will open the conference on Friday afternoon with a speech expected to seek to shore up transatlantic ties while also emphasizing the need to strengthen the European Union, a German government official said earlier this week.

Around 70 heads of state and government and more than 140 ministers, including Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar are expected under tight security in Munich.

Christine Lagarde is due to be the first European Central Bank president to address the event, underlining how efforts to make Europe's economy more resilient are seen as part of the wider political stakes.

A large delegation from the U.S. Congress had also been expected to accompany Rubio but many pulled out to stay in Washington for a closely watched House vote on funding the Department of Homeland Security.

Russia is not sending a delegation and the forum withdrew invitations to Iranian officials after the Tehran government's countrywide crackdown on protests last month, in which thousands of people have been reported killed. Instead the son of the last Shah of Iran is expected to give a speech, while a large Iranian opposition rally is seen taking place in town.

After bringing NATO to the brink of implosion over his threats to annex Greenland, Trump appears to have backed off for the moment, after heavy pressure from many of his own supporters, said Claudia Major, senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund overseeing its work on transatlantic security.

She noted, however, that the underlying shift in transatlantic relations had not changed, pointing out that Rubio's next stops in Europe were Hungary and Slovakia, both run by nationalist leaders who often clash with the EU on key issues such as Ukraine.

But she said the meeting could nonetheless offer European allies an opportunity to press for continued support from Washington for Ukraine, in particular on security guarantees.

"If there were progress on questions like these, then there would also be progress on the overarching issue: are we moving closer to a ceasefire that truly ends the war and does not plant the seeds for the next one?" REUTERS

U.S. President Donald Trump points his finger towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they shake hands during a press conference after meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., December 29, 2025. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst

Published Feb 13, 2026, 01:46 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 01:50 AM

JERUSALEM, Feb 12 - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said he hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump was creating the conditions to reach a deal with Iran that would avoid military action.

Netanyahu, who met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, said he had expressed "general scepticism" and said that if an agreement was reached, "it must include the elements that are very important to Israel."

They include a halt to Iran's nuclear programme, limits on its ballistic missiles and Iran’s proxies, he added.

Wednesday's meeting was the seventh between Trump and Netanyahu since Trump returned to office last year. Netanyahu - whose visit was more muted than usual and closed to the press - was looking to influence the next round of U.S. discussions with Iran following nuclear negotiations held in Oman last Friday.

The two leaders spoke behind closed doors for more than two-and-a-half hours in what Trump described as a "very good meeting".

But the U.S. president said no major decisions were made and stopped short of publicly accepting Netanyahu's entreaties.

"We have a very close, very genuine, and very open relationship," Netanyahu said, noting the discussions focused on several issues, but primarily on the negotiations with Iran, and Trump wanted to "hear my opinion."

"The President believes that the Iranians have already learned who they are dealing with," he said. "I think that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time by not reaching an agreement, may create the circumstances for achieving a good deal."

Text: US President Donald Trump addressed reporters Thursday evening regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, commenting on a range of political and security issues.

Trump criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog, saying, “President Herzog should be ashamed for not granting Netanyahu a pardon. He has the power to pardon and didn’t use it. The people of Israel should shame him."

On Iran, Trump warned that Tehran “must make a deal, or it will be traumatic for them. I don’t want that to happen. They should have made a deal, and they didn’t. If they don’t reach an agreement, it will be a different story."

Speaking about his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump said, “I had a good meeting with the prime minister, and he understands, but it depends on me. If the deal is fair, it will be tough for them. It needs to be quick-within a month, I think."

When asked whether Netanyahu had requested that he stop communicating with Iran, Trump replied, “He didn’t ask me to stop. I’ll speak with them as much as I want. But if we don’t reach phase two, it will be tough for them. I don’t expect that to happen."

Addressing Netanyahu’s responsibility for the October 7 attacks, Trump said, “Everyone is responsible. It was a terrible attack. He didn’t see it coming, and no one else would have in his place. He was a great prime minister for a time of war."

The Israeli president’s office responded: “For clarity, as repeatedly emphasized, the prime minister’s request is under review according to Ministry of Justice procedures. Only after this process is complete will the president examine the request based on the law, the best interest of the state, and his conscience, without any influence from external or internal pressures."

It added, “President Herzog appreciates President Trump’s significant contribution to Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state governed by law. Contrary to the impression created by President Trump’s remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on this matter."

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Iran Thursday with "very traumatic" consequences if it fails to make a nuclear deal -- but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was skeptical about the quality of any such agreement.

Speaking a day after he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said he hoped for a result "over the next month" from Washington's negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.

"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters. "This will be very traumatic for Iran if they don't make a deal."

Trump -- who is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to pressure Iran -- recalled the U.S. military strikes he ordered on Tehran's nuclear facilities during Israel's 12-day war with Iran in July last year.

"We'll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can't, we'll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them," Trump said.

Netanyahu had traveled to Washington to push Trump to take a harder line in the Iran nuclear talks, particularly on including the Islamic Republic's arsenal of ballistic missiles.

But the Israeli and U.S. leaders apparently remained at odds, with Trump saying after their meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he had insisted the negotiations should continue.

Netanyahu said in Washington on Thursday before departing for Israel that Trump believed he was laying the ground for a deal.

"He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn't reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal," Netanyahu said, according to a video statement from his office.

But the Israeli premier added: "I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran."

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

"It's not just the nuclear issue," he said.

Despite their differences on Iran, Trump signaled his strong personal support for Netanyahu as he criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog for rejecting his request to pardon the prime minister on corruption charges.

"You have a president that refuses to give him a pardon. I think that man should be ashamed of himself," Trump said on Thursday.

Trump has repeatedly hinted at potential U.S. military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests last month, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman.

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel's war with Iran and the U.S. strikes.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear program. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to "excessive demands" on the subject.

Cry wolf all you like Trump.....you got military advice last round of threats NOT to go ahead and stage a full scale attack

Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Exactly.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu. Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Trump's downfall is listening to genocidal manic Netanyahu.

Oh, I disagree

Only way for peace in middle-east is to disarm Israel and throw out its criminal regime. World has seen enough of bs coming out of Netanyahu's mouth. He needs to behind bars.

Yeah, sure. lol

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

So Trump is sending the fleet to bomb Iran....after saying this during his campaign...

"During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump’s comments on Middle East conflicts focused on ending wars and emphasizing his "America First" non-interventionist stance.

Ending "Endless Wars": Trump campaigned on the promise to "turn the page forever on those foolish, stupid days of never-ending wars," often contrasting himself with "warmongers" like Nikki Haley.

Peace Through Strength: He maintained that his legacy would be that of a "peacemaker," claiming he was the only president in generations who did not start a new war.

And one more campaign promise betrayed...

Explain that ? Trump is an idiot is my best guess

I think the guy is a genius, no capitulation, no apologies and keeping Iran on their toes and on high notice.

The convicted felon and Intimidator-in-Chief has spoken.

War mongering and peace making are quite the contrary.

When Biden did this he was a ‘fake tough guy war monger’.

What changed?

Bass....well Trump is a genius in not paying taxes.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if he can't bury the Epstein files.

FIFY


A reminder that Iran signed a nuclear agreement in 2015 with six countries, including the United States, Russia and China. The purpose of the agreement was to ease economic sanctions in exchange for restrictions on Iran’s nuclear development program. However, in 2018, during his first term in office, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement.

Iran insists that its nuclear development program is designed for peaceful purposes — securing nuclear fuel for nuclear power generation — and that it will continue uranium enrichment.

To put into contest the hypocrisy of the US administration, let’s not forget that Mossadegh, Iran's prime minister, was overthrown in a 1953 CIA-backed coup known as Operation Ajax. His government had nationalized Iran's oil industry, angering both the British and the U.S. After his removal, the Shah was restored to power, marking the beginning of an authoritarian regime until the 1979 Revolution.

The self described billionaire recently outed as paying $750 in two years during this decade.

What does it have to do with anything, you always go on some weird  tangent, it has nothing to do with Biden capitulating to Iran and Trump doing what he said he is going to do, liberals can talk about convicted felon all this other nonsense, but what is clear and what only matters is that he's putting these mullets unnoticed and that is a good thing for the United States and for the world, especially the region

Still the typical so-called tough guy, but no one is scared except his supporters.

But but billionaire Trump didn’t pay taxes?

umm…what? Iran? Huh?

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

at least he’s back to billionaire again in the new narratives.

Handing over the own Afhanistan trauma to Iran or suffer another own Big Armada trauma, that is a fifty-fifty outcome. Better toss a coin, that's less bloody.

But Remember that nonsense “he’s broke” narrative? lol

Not since he started moonlighting selling crypto instead of working for his actual bosses.

Try telling your boss you can “walk and chew gum” when he finds you’re not doing your job, see how that goes.

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

BlacklabelToday  12:43 pm JST

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if there is no nuclear deal

Has he got some trash racist memes ready to go on Truth Social?

Iran knows there will be no US troops on the ground, so not really that traumatic at all.

Don't need to have troops on the ground to help destabilize the nation.

Yep he does. But really just satire. A funny joke or two.

Yes he discovered tremendous opportunities for graft with his cult members and by being potus.

Not so different from your favorite previous WH occupants then.

As much hate as your team has thrown at Biden, that's some admission - "he's the same as Joe"...and thanks for admitting he's a corrupt grifter...

Remember when Trump and MAGA-world condemned its fellow Repub NEOCONs as "warmongers who start endless conflicts in the Middle East"....and that he was going to "end all wars"?

Yea, that was THEN....now it's "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran"...."Send in the Marines"...."Get tough"....

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES....

Surprised?  Shouldn't be...

"I'll protect the unborn"....flat out lie....he's OK with 15 week abortions...

"I'll defend the 2nd Amendment"....clear lie - he's now for gun control....

"I'll release the Epstein file"...we know what a "huuuge" lie that turned out be....

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...and a lot of them are outraged...at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

So all that pre-election promises of no new wars were all LIES

oh are we at war with anyone right now?

if so, who and where?

The facts are Trump has betrayed his voters on almost every campaign promise...

No, he really didn't not to the point where its enraging anyone

and a lot of them are outraged...

Some, but that just goes with the territory

at his LIES....and the ones who aren't are just too humiliated to admit it...

All politicians lie, but most of policy executions done extraordinarily well.

WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump threatened Iran on Feb 12 with “very traumatic” consequences if it fails to make a nuclear deal – but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was sceptical about the quality of any such agreement.

Speaking a day after

he hosted Mr Netanyahu at the White House

“We have to make a deal, otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don’t want that to happen, but we have to make a deal,” Mr Trump told reporters.

“This will be very traumatic for Iran if they don’t make a deal.”

Mr Trump – who is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to pressure Iran – recalled the US military strikes he ordered on Tehran’s nuclear facilities during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in July 2025.

“We’ll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can’t, we’ll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them,” Mr Trump said.

Mr Netanyahu had travelled to Washington to push Mr Trump to take a harder line in the Iran nuclear talks, particularly on including the Islamic Republic’s arsenal of ballistic missiles.

But the Israeli and US leaders apparently remained at odds, with Mr Trump saying after their meeting at the White House on Feb 11 that he had insisted the negotiations should continue.

Mr Netanyahu said in Washington on Feb 12 before departing for Israel that Mr Trump believed he was laying the ground for a deal.

“He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn’t reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal,” Mr Netanyahu said, according to a video statement from his office.

But the Israeli premier added: “I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran.”

Any deal “must include the elements that are very important from our perspective,” Mr Netanyahu continued, listing Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

“It’s not just the nuclear issue,” he said.

Despite their differences on Iran, Mr Trump signalled his strong personal support for Mr Netanyahu as he criticised Israeli President Isaac Herzog for rejecting his request to pardon the prime minister on corruption charges.

“You have a president that refuses to give him a pardon. I think that man should be ashamed of himself,” Mr Trump said on Feb 12.

Mr Trump has repeatedly hinted at potential US military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests in January, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman.

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel’s war with Iran and the US strikes.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear programme. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to “excessive demands” on the subject. AFP

Text: President Donald Trump warned Thursday that the Iranian regime faces a “very traumatic” outcome if a “good and fair” deal with the United States is not reached “over the next month,” signaling that failure would trigger a punishing “phase two.”

Speaking at a White House press conference one day after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump was asked if his thinking had changed on the negotiations and timeline.

“We have to make a deal, otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic — very traumatic,” Trump said. “I don’t want that to happen, but we have to make a deal.”

Trump argued Tehran “should have made a deal the first time,” adding, “they got Midnight Hammer instead,” invoking Operation Midnight Hammer — the U.S. strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites roughly six months ago that capped the 12-day Israel-Iran war.

“We had a very good meeting yesterday with Bibi Netanyahu, and he understands. But it’s ultimately up to me,” Trump continued.

“If the deal isn’t a very fair deal and a very good deal with Iran, then it’s going to be, I think, a very difficult time for them,” he added.

Pressed on the timeline, Trump said, “I guess over the next month.” He added, “They should agree very quickly.”

Asked if he should stop talking to Iran, Trump rejected the premise.

“I’ll talk to them as long as I like,” he said. “And we’ll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can’t, we’ll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them. I’m not looking for that.”

Netanyahu, departing Washington on Thursday, said his talks with Trump centered “primarily” on Iran and that the president believes the Iranians “already understand who they are dealing with.”

The Israeli leader said Trump believes the conditions he is creating — combined with Iran’s understanding it “made a mistake last time” by not reaching an agreement — could produce the conditions for what Netanyahu called a “good deal.”

“I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the nature of any agreement with Iran,” Netanyahu said, adding that if an agreement is reached, it must include what he described as vital elements — “not only the nuclear issue,” but also “the ballistic missiles and the Iranian proxies.”

Trump’s warning Thursday followed his sharper message earlier in the week that Tehran would be “foolish” not to deal as U.S. forces move into position.

“We have a massive flotilla right now going over to Iran … I think they want to make a deal. I think they’d be foolish if they didn’t,” Trump told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow on Tuesday, adding, “We took out their nuclear power last time, and we’ll have to see if we take out more this time…”

Trump said he would “rather make a deal,” but stressed it must be “a good deal,” laying out his baseline: “No nuclear weapons, no missiles…”

That threat of escalation is colliding with Tehran’s declared red lines.

Iran has publicly insisted negotiations be limited strictly to nuclear enrichment levels — not enrichment itself — and has rejected any discussion of missiles or regional proxy forces.

On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said indirect negotiations with the United States will proceed if Tehran concludes Washington has the “necessary seriousness” to reach a negotiated resolution and has agreed to drop what he called “excessive and unrealistic” demands.

On Wednesday, Ali Shamkhani — a senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader — declared the regime’s missile program a “red line” and “non-negotiable” as the Islamic Republic staged rallies marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 revolution.

Videos and images from the government-backed events showed demonstrators burning American flags and chanting “Death to America,” while staged mock coffins bearing the name and image of CENTCOM Commander Gen. Brad Cooper appeared along the parade routes.

Senior figures within Iran’s leadership were present throughout the commemorations, including Araghchi — Tehran’s lead negotiator — highlighting the regime’s direct involvement in the spectacle even as talks continue.

Iran paired the diplomatic track with fresh threats earlier in the week as well.

On Tuesday, Iran’s Army chief, Major General Amir Hatami, warned that any enemy “miscalculation” would be met with an “unprecedented” response.

The heightened rhetoric has been accompanied by visible defensive preparations at sensitive sites.

High-resolution imagery taken Monday showed Iran backfilling entrances to a hardened tunnel complex at the Isfahan nuclear facility, with the Institute for Science and International Security assessing the work appeared complete and arguing it signals Tehran is “seriously concerned” about a potential U.S. or Israeli strike or raid.

U.S. posture across the region has tightened in parallel, including satellite-image analysis reported Tuesday describing Patriot air defense systems at Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar placed on mobile launchers to increase mobility and rapid repositioning.

As the military backdrop builds, Trump on Thursday reshared a Wall Street Journal report indicating the Pentagon is preparing a second aircraft carrier strike group for possible deployment to the Middle East — after he said Tuesday he was considering sending another carrier if negotiations collapse.

A separate Wall Street Journal report published Thursday said the Trump administration covertly sent thousands of Starlink satellite internet terminals into Iran after last month’s protest crackdown and regime internet shutdowns, an effort described as aimed at keeping dissidents online despite Tehran’s restrictions.

For now, Trump is publicly holding open the diplomatic track — while warning the decision point is close.

“We have to make a deal,” Trump said. “Otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic.”

Text: Global economic engagement is and was riddled with contradictions. We aspired for growth yet feared competition. This diffidence shaped our early approach to trade. PM Narendra Modi has acted with panache. The present engagement on FTAs with the EU and US represents a discontinuity with the past. The US deal is not an isolated initiative but integral to a long, uneven journey from protectionist to purposeful participation in global trade.

After Independence, barter trade was inescapable. In the gray corridors of the Soviet bloc, we swapped tea for machinery and rice for oil. It was a world where freedom of choice was traded for the comfort of certainty. State entities like the State Trading Corporation and the Mines and Minerals Trading Corporation canalised foreign trade in a debilitating trade regime. I witnessed this caution firsthand in 1973 while negotiating concessional oil with the Shah of Iran as the global economy buckled under the first oil crisis. Today, however, our deepening engagement with the United States represents the shedding of that protectionist skin.

My engagement with these issues began in 1969 when I joined as undersecretary in the Ministry of Commerce. I participated in GATT and UNCTAD negotiations and later during the transition to the WTO. At the time, we took pride in negotiating stratospheric bound tariff rates while keeping applied rates at more acceptable levels. As Anne Krueger argued, such protectionist regimes encourage rent-seeking, stifle competitiveness, and misallocate resources.

The Tokyo Round attempted to discipline non-tariff barriers, but the Uruguay Round altered the landscape by creating the WTO. It expanded non-trade sovereign obligations. For developing nations, this sharpened anxieties. It introduced non-trade issues of investment and procurement policy into a forum designed primarily for trade issues. These divides were further exposed in Cancun and later in Seattle. On December 1, 1999, during the Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference, President Bill Clinton’s attempt to introduce labour and investment standards met with massive protests. PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee tasked me to assist the delegation’s leader, Murasoli Maran, then Minister of Commerce and Industry. The US presidency’s whims derailed these negotiations. Whims mattered then as they do now.

Today, that rules-based order is strained by complex supply chains, industrial subsidies, and the rise of state capitalism. With its dispute settlement mechanism in shambles, the WTO has lost its functional credibility. We are witnessing the “trilemma” articulated by Dani Rodrik: Deep globalisation, democratic politics, and national sovereignty cannot be simultaneously maximised. In this vacuum, FTAs have displaced multilateral ambition. Jagdish Bhagwati’s critique of the “spaghetti bowl” of overlapping rules remains valid, and Paul Krugman correctly cautions against viewing trade deals as universal remedies. Yet, these arrangements deliver the predictability that markets crave.

India’s evolution mirrors this realism. Following the 1991 crisis, trade liberalisation became the first ingredient of India’s response. Initiated by a Congress government, these reforms dismantled extreme insulation. Fears of deindustrialisation proved baseless; Indian industry adapted and emerged globally competitive. Having come of age, India can no longer prosper behind walls of excessive protection.

Our current choices reflect a sophisticated understanding of strategic autonomy. It is not a purist doctrine but a practical instrument shaped by cost-benefit calculations. Access to American technology, capital, and markets have long-term value. Cooperation with the US and the EU strengthens domestic economic and defence capabilities. Diversifying external partnerships enhances India’s strategic leverage, becoming a more consequential partner, better insulated against future uncertainties.

Crucially, the new India-US interim arrangement does not leave us harshly exposed. Agriculture remains a vital political and social anchor; providing livelihoods for 45 per cent of our population despite contributing only 18 per cent to GDP. Diversification into value-added agro-activities reduces overload and enhances incomes in the farming sector. Interestingly, Bangladesh’s “free access” to the US came at the cost of exposing sensitive domestic agricultural sectors to American scale and subsidies.

The India-US interim arrangement, alongside our successful negotiations with the EU, must be viewed through this lens of calibrated market access. The US agreement signals an ambition for trade and procurement flows approaching $500 billion over five years. In 2024-25, India exported $86.5 billion in merchandise to the US; 20 per cent of our total exports. Until recently, nearly $41 billion of those exports faced reciprocal tariffs as high as 50 per cent. We are not reducing tariffs to zero. We are pursuing a balanced outcome that protects our industrial base while securing zero-duty access for high-margin sectors where India dominates, such as generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts. While our reciprocal rate stands at a balanced 18 per cent, other exporters face significantly higher barriers: China at 35 per cent, Vietnam at 20 per cent and ASEAN nations at 19 per cent. This is neither a total victory nor a debilitating loss. In complex trade negotiations, unlike the ABBA song “The winner takes it all, the loser must fall”, there are no absolute winners or losers.

Without this interim arrangement, India would face elevated tariffs, a widening competitiveness gap, and hemorrhaging of foreign investment. Such outward capital flight puts continuing pressure on exchange rates and currency management, making reserves increasingly vulnerable. Further, avoiding the 25 per cent tariff linked to Russia-related measures carries immense signalling value. The certainty and openness of India’s future support greater investor confidence and greater US investment flows. Judicial reforms, Bilateral investment protection treaties, and considering credible arbitration frameworks such as the Abu Dhabi Global Market could further fortify both investment flows and investor comfort.

Trade negotiations are rarely one-sided and must be judged within a long-term geopolitical frame. The world is adjusting to US power politics, but India’s task is precise: Securing market access and investment amid strategic churn.

A successful negotiation is often said to leave all sides equally dissatisfied. If this agreement raises exports and deepens technical-industrial capability during a disorderly global transition, it is a substantial achievement. It is ironic that a momentous mindset shift is met with prevarication. India is mature enough to seek purposeful engagement with a credible place in the global value added chain. What could have been a moment missed has become a moment seized.

</entities>
Text: Tarique Rahman, leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and son of former Prime Minister the late Khaleda Zia, is poised to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister.

In his maiden speech after his return to the country after 17 years of self-imposed exile in England, Rahman recalled the famous “I Have a Dream” speech of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King. However, he remarked that while MLK had a dream, he himself had a plan to build a nation that is safe and inclusive for all citizens, irrespective of faith and region. The moment has now arrived to test whether that plan can translate into reality.

On the domestic front, Bangladesh today faces deep polarisation along political, cultural, and religious lines. The new regime must, therefore, undertake bold and innovative interventions during the initial “honeymoon period” of governance. Despite his electoral success, Rahman is nowhere close to the mass popularity once enjoyed by Bangladesh’s founding Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who faced his first public protest in September 1972, merely eight months into office. Public expectations today are no less demanding than those at the birth of the nation.

Beyond the familiar challenges of corruption, unemployment, and law and order, the most pressing issue confronting Tarique Rahman’s government is how to deal with Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League. There is an uncomfortable truth in Hasina’s recent assertion that “a government born of exclusion cannot unite a divided nation.” Although the 2026 elections may be the most credible since 2009, their legitimacy would have been far stronger had the Awami League participated.

Tarique Rahman now faces a critical choice: Pursue a path of political vengeance, as has often been the case in Pakistan, or adopt a reconciliatory approach inspired by South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation initiatives. The latter could involve granting Sheikh Hasina a pardon, allowing her return to Dhaka, but barring her and her family from future political participation while reintegrating the Awami League into the democratic process.

One of the major structural obstacles to democracy in Bangladesh, as in much of South Asia, is dynastic politics. Denying future political roles to Hasina’s family would mark a significant step toward de-dynastification. However, such reform would require Rahman to initiate similar internal reforms within the BNP. Without dismantling dynastic dominance, Bangladesh’s democracy will remain half-baked.

On the geopolitical front, the harsh reality is that most nation-states today are compelled to navigate great power rivalries, often at a heavy cost. Venezuela, Ukraine, and Iran offer stark examples. Bangladesh is no exception. Rahman’s challenge will be balancing relations with key regional and global actors, particularly India, China, Pakistan, and the United States. During his tenure, Yunus signaled a shift toward closer ties with China and Pakistan, a move that’s not gone down well with India. Meanwhile, in her first interview after arriving in Delhi, Sheikh Hasina alleged American involvement in her exit, though her own governance failures were significant.

For Rahman, repairing Indo-Bangladesh relations must be a top priority, perhaps even drawing lessons from aspects of Hasina’s earlier diplomacy. Two issues will be decisive: The treatment of religious minorities, particularly Hindus, and Bangladesh’s posture toward militant groups operating in India’s Northeast. Never has it been clearer that minority rights across South Asia are deeply interconnected. The entire South Asian leadership needs to reflect on how to address the issue in a long-term fashion. Under Yunus, Dhaka not only failed to curb violence against Hindus but at times appeared complicit, despite his conciliatory rhetoric.

The only durable guarantee for minority safety lies in restoring Bangladesh’s secular constitutional ethos — an ambition that appears increasingly difficult given the growing influence of Jamaat-e-Islami. Yet without this foundational shift, any democratic transformation in Bangladesh will remain elusive.

In a message posted on his X account, Iran’s top diplomat wrote that millions of Iranians took to the streets to celebrate the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution of what scholars call ‘The Last Great Revolution of the 20th Century”.

“Much has happened in the decades since the Islamic Revolution, and particularly the past twelve months. Over the last year alone, our people have been subject to an unprecedented attack by two nuclear-armed regimes and then a massive terrorist operation; yet the Islamic Republic of Iran has always stood strong,” he added.

“This resilience is deep-rooted in our reliance on our OWN people, not foreign regimes,” Araghchi underlined.

“I sincerely hope the coming year will be a Year of Peace and Tranquility, with Dialogue Prevailing over War. Our preference is diplomacy, and a deal on Iran’s peaceful nuclear program is achievable; but only if fair and balanced. To this end, Iran will not shy away from defending its sovereignty, whatever the cost. As millions of Iranians once again made clear today: our rights and our dignity are not for sale,” he stated.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Houthi said the historic resistance of the two countries carries important lessons for the Muslim world, reinforcing hope and confidence in divine promises.

He added that the shared experience has been reinforced as adversaries of Islam and humanity are pushing forward their schemes -- among them the so-called “New Middle East” and “Greater Israel” -- using their proxies and allies.

He also extended his congratulations to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and the Iranian people on the anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

He emphasized that the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran led to the establishment of an independent Muslim country free from US hegemony, according to Press TV.

The Yemeni leader praised Iran’s steadfastness against the Israeli regime’s conspiracies for 47 years, while supporting oppressed nations, foremost among them the Palestinian people.

Text: TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (MNA) – The United States and Iran are showing flexibility on a nuclear deal, with Washington appearing "willing to tolerate" some nuclear enrichment, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said.

“It is positive that the Americans appear willing to tolerate Iranian enrichment within clearly set boundaries," Fidan, who has been involved in talks with both Washington and Tehran, told the FT in an interview published on Thursday.

“... the Americans understand that the Iranians have certain limits. It’s pointless to try to force them,” the Turkish foreign minister added.

Washington has until now demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity.

Fidan told the FT he believed Tehran “genuinely wants to reach a real agreement” and would accept restrictions on enrichment levels and a strict inspection regime, as it did in the 2015 agreement with the US and others.

US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy.

The Turkish foreign minister, however, cautioned that broadening the Iran-US talks to ballistic missiles would bring "nothing but another war."

This will put two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships in the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and three guided-missile destroyers arrived in the Middle East more than two weeks ago.

The USS Ford, which set out on deployment in June 2025, was sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last fall as the administration established a significant military presence ahead of the operation to strike Venezuela and capture its president, Nicolás Maduro.

"It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly," he told reporters.

Text: TEHRAN, Feb. 12 (MNA) – Iran’s ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva has said that Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to diplomacy to help promotion of world peace.

Speaking on the occasion of 47th victory anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Ali Bahreini emphasized that Islamic Revolution of Iran reflected the will of a nation that was seeking dignity, sovereignty and self-determination.

Not only the Islamic Revolution changed the political order, but also revived the national ownership over its destiny after the revolution, Bahreini underlined.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has pursued a path based on independence, social justice, public participation, and rejection of domination, despite numerous external pressures and challenges, since the glorious victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the ambassador emphasized.

The true dialogue can only succeed when it is based on respect, equality and recognition of the legitimate interests, he added.

Text: An Iranian reporter landed his station in hot water after he accidentally said “Death to Khamenei” during a televised celebration of the Islamic Revolution’s 47th anniversary.

Musab Rasoulizad was covering the rally on Wednesday in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province when he was repeating the chants heard in the crowd and mistakenly repeated a famous anti-regime cry aimed against Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

“Marg bar Khamenei,” Rasoulizad said, which is Arabic for “Death to Khamenei.”

The moment quickly went viral, with state officials immediately condemning Rasoulizad and firing his boss over the blunder.

“The broadcast director of Hamoun provincial TV channel has been dismissed following an error that occurred on the provincial network,” the Saudi state-owned  Al Arabiya outlet quoted Iran’s state television authority.

“The transmission operator and broadcast supervisor were suspended. Other staff found at fault were also referred to the disciplinary committee,” officials added.

Rasoulizad offered an apology afterwards, saying the moment was just a “slip of the tongue and blunder” that has now gone viral among anti-regime protesters, according to  Al Arabiya.

Rasoulizad’s mistake has been paired up with another viral incident that took place during the anniversary celebration, where a mosque sermon uttered the same phrase as well.

Video from inside Iran captured the moment a voice on a loudspeaker was reiterating famous, nationalist chants, including “Death to America,” when the announcer accidentally says, “Death to Khamen—” before being cut off.

Those witnessing the moment could be heard laughing at the blunder.

Despite the embarrassing moments, Khamenei hailed Wednesday’s nationwide celebrations as a testament to his nation’s unity following last month’s protests calling for an end to his regime.

“National unity is of great value. Let us all strive to preserve this cohesion and national solidarity,” Khamenei wrote on X.
