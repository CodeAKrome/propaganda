- **Capabilities highlighted:** Equipment displayed at the parade suggests a focus on battlefield intelligence and drone counter‑measure systems—skills that could support China’s maritime control plans.
- **Key revelation:** Chinese leader Xi Jinping confirmed, via a Lunar New Year video greeting, that the PLA’s Cyberspace Force operates a cyber‑warfare facility on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands.
- **Potential implications:** China’s upgraded radar and cyber infrastructure could enable it to contest the electromagnetic spectrum, possibly facilitating a maritime “wall” of fishing‑boat blockades that might disrupt shipping lanes or support a future Taiwan blockade or invasion.
- **Strategic context:** Fiery Cross Reef (China’s Yongshu Jiao) lies in a contested area claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. China has built artificial islands there and elsewhere (e.g., Antelope Reef, Paracels) to support permanent military installations.
- **Unit background:** The Cyberspace Force was publicly acknowledged only last September during the 2025 Victory Day parade in Beijing; analysts trace its formal establishment to 2024.
