Summary

BARCELONA - Powerful winds topping 100kmh per hour battered Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia on Feb 12, injuring 86 people – three of them seriously – and forcing school closures and flight restrictions.

Storm Nils comes on the heels of

three other episodes of extreme weather

Gusts reached 105kmh at Barcelona port, toppling trees and walls and prompting dozens of emergency calls, the Catalan civil protection agency said.

A total of 86 people required medical attention, with 34 taken to hospitals, the agency said.

Among them, two remain in serious condition and one in critical condition.

At Barcelona’s El Prat airport – Spain’s second busiest – 101 flights were cancelled and 10 diverted, airport operator Aena said.

Some roads and rail lines were also disrupted.

The strong wind episode was “exceptional” for Barcelona and its metropolitan area, said the director of Catalonia’s meteorological service, Sarai Sarroca.

Authorities in the region of around eight million residents suspended classes and non-urgent medical appointments, urging people to limit movement until the evening of Feb 12 when winds were expected to calm.

By reducing their travel, people helped prevent a higher number of accidents, the head of the region’s interior department, Ms Nuria Parlon, told a news conference.

The storm also hit parts of neighbouring Portugal and France.

In Portugal, flooding partially collapsed a highway viaduct between Lisbon and Porto when a river burst its banks.

The stretch of motorway had already been closed before it collapsed.

In southwestern France, a truck driver was killed by a falling tree and some 900,000 homes were without power.

Scientists say the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is due to climate change linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions. AFP

The bodies of two babies were found by police in a freezer at a house in Ailleviller-et-Lyaumont, eastern France, on Feb 12.


Summary


Published Feb 13, 2026, 02:04 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 06:32 AM

AILLEVILLERS-ET-LYAUMONT, France - French police have detained a 50-year-old woman after two infants were found dead in a freezer in eastern France, with the suspect admitting to freezing her newborns, prosecutors said on Feb 12.

The case is the latest suspected instance of infanticide to emerge in France in recent years.

The grim discovery was made after the woman, who had nine children from three different fathers, had abruptly left the family home in the eastern town of Aillevillers-et-Lyaumont in December.

She left behind four of her children aged 14 to 20, their father, and a fifth child from another relationship.

On Feb 10, a family member discovered the body of a newborn baby in a freezer.

After the family raised the alarm, police discovered a second body in the same freezer, wrapped in a bag.

Suspicion quickly focused on the mother.

The woman, who was arrested in the western Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt on Feb 11, admitted to having frozen her two babies after they were born, prosecutor Cedric Logelin told a news conference.

“She had wrapped the newborns immediately after giving birth and then immediately placed them in the freezer, located in the laundry room,” said Mr Logelin.

The woman had worn loose-fitting clothes to hide the pregnancies from her family and friends.

“During questioning, she cried very frequently and said she felt sorry for her children and her family,” the prosecutor added.

The suspect was unable to say when exactly the babies were born.

She said the children were born between 2011 and 2018 when she returned to work, said magistrate Christine de Curraize.

Her partner, who was also taken into custody, claimed that he was “unaware of these pregnancies and was taken completely by surprise”, the prosecutor said.

An autopsy will be performed on Feb 13 to determine the exact circumstances of the infants’ deaths.

In Aillevillers-et-Lyaumont, seals were visible on the shutters of a light-coloured, one-storey house with an open gate, an AFP photographer noted.

A judicial investigation has been opened for the murder of minors under the age of 15, crimes punishable by life imprisonment, said Mr Logelin.

The public prosecutor’s office has requested that the suspect be placed in pre-trial detention.

Mayor Jean-Claude Tramesel expressed his “shock” after learning of the discovery.

“It’s a small village of 1,500 inhabitants. When it comes to news stories like this, you always think it happens somewhere else,” he told AFP. “We’re stunned.”

Referring to the couple, Mr Tramesel said that they “have lived in the town for about 20 years but do not work here”.

“They are people who keep to themselves,” he added.

In 2022, two newborn babies were discovered in a woman’s freezer in southern France. Prosecutors said their deaths were “not natural in origin”.

In 2015, five bodies were found in a similar case, which saw the mother handed an eight-year jail term.

Another case which went down in French legal annals was that of Veronique Courjault, who received an eight-year sentence in 2009 for killing three of her newborn children. AFP

Switzerland is set to vote this summer on a proposal aimed at capping the country’s population at 10 million, the latest effort by the nation’s leading right-wing party to restrict immigration.

The Swiss People’s Party (SVP), which holds the most seats in parliament, announced the referendum on Wednesday after gathering enough support through petition signatures.

The measure, which will be put on the national ballot on June 14, comes just as the population neared 9.1 million, according to the Federal Statistics Office.

The anti-immigration campaign was proposed as officials noted that foreign-born residents now make up about 27 percent of the population.

The SVP, which has long sought to curb rising migration, said that more than 1 million immigrants from the European Union (EU) came to Switzerland in 2024.

The party called the situation "uncontrolled immigration," saying that "the majority of the Swiss population suffers" from increased demand on environmental resources and infrastructure.

"Our small country is bursting at the seams," the party said. "Nature is being paved over. There are ever more traffic jams on the roads, overburdened public transport, overburdened schools, housing shortage and rising rents, massively increasing crime and exploding costs for Swiss taxpayers."

If the measure is enshrined into law, both Swiss citizens and foreign residents must not exceed a total population of 10 million before 2050.

If the population reaches 9.5 million before then, the government may take steps to curb growth by introducing measures on asylum and family reunification, noting that many immigrants — primarily Muslim men from North Africa, the Middle East, and Afghanistan — enter through asylum applications.

GREENLAND'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS 'WE CHOOSE DENMARK' OVER THE US

Major Swiss political parties outside the SVP, including centrist, left-leaning and liberal groups, have reportedly rejected the initiative.

Critics cautioned that the passing of such measure could strain Switzerland’s relations with its European neighbors, as most foreign-born residents hail from other EU countries.

In response, the SVP said lawmakers "could not have made it clearer that they don't care about the concerns of the population, which is increasingly suffering from uncontrolled immigration."

They also stressed that they do not intend to terminate the "free movement of persons agreement with the EU," which allows European citizens to move and work freely across borders, and said such cancellation would remain a last resort if the Federal Council fails to limit immigration.

Text: World Jewish Congress (WJC) President Ronald S. Lauder on Thursday called for the removal of UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, joining a growing list of those who have called for her removal due to her constant anti-Israel statements.

In a statement ahead of his attendance at this week’s Munich Security Conference, Lauder said, “Amid growing geopolitical turbulence and a disturbing rise in antisemitism, it is essential that world leaders stand firmly behind US President Donald J. Trump’s initiatives to promote stability, ensure the safety of the Jewish people, and advance peace."

“Key among these is the recent sanctioning of UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, a dangerous figure who continues to use her position to promote discredited conspiracy theories, divisive and antisemitic narratives, and who represents an extremist ideological agenda rather than that of the United Nations," added the WJC President.

“As I meet with leaders in Munich and in the weeks ahead, I will advocate for a clear moral line to be drawn. Individuals such as Ms. Albanese must be removed from the UN before more damage can be done to the Jewish people - and the institution’s mission," he concluded.

Earlier on Thursday, Austria and Germany called for the resignation of Albanese following her recent remarks calling Israel the "common enemy of humanity."

The French government previously called for Albanese to step down over the remarks. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers that France "unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks made by Ms. Francesca Albanese, which are directed not at the Israeli government, whose policies may be criticized, but at Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable."

The calls for her removal follow remarks delivered at the Al Jazeera conference, in which Albanese had said: “The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support ... We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy."


Albanese’s history of anti-Israel statements and actions is well-documented and dates back to social media posts uncovered in 2022, in which she claimed that the “Jewish lobby" controls the US.

At the time, Albanese rejected arguments that the comments about the “Jewish lobby" were antisemitic and claimed they were “mischaracterized", but her anti-Israel bias has continued to be exposed since.

Her criticism of Israel has grown since Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack in Israel. The attack, in which Hamas terrorists killed over 1,200 people and took 250 hostages, was described by Albanese as an act that must be viewed in “context" and as a response to Israeli “aggression."

She has also in recent months accused Israel of genocide, likened the Government of Israel to the “Third Reich," and compared Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.

Text: MOSCOW, February 12. /TASS/. The Kiev regime is ready to go to literally any lengths to prevent the achievement of a just peace in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said during a briefing.

She noted that few European states undermine Russia-US negotiation efforts as much as France.

TASS has compiled the diplomat’s key statements.

Russia is still defining its position regarding the Board of Peace. "Work on shaping the position is ongoing," the diplomat said during a briefing.

Russia will not send delegates to the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace. "Russia will not take part in the [upcoming] Board of Peace meeting," Zakharova said.

The Kiev regime is deliberately intensifying terrorist attacks on Russian civilian infrastructure during key international negotiations on conflict resolution.

The assassination attempt on Russian Lieutenant-General Vladimir Alexeyev, First Deputy Chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff, has revealed the intent of the Kiev regime, led by Vladimir Zelensky, to derail the negotiation process on the Ukrainian settlement.

Kiev is prepared to go to virtually any extent in an attempt to prevent the achievement of a just peace in Ukraine.

The Kiev regime directly supports terrorists on the African continent and supplies them with weaponry: "Africa is suffering from the uncontrolled influx of Western arms to the Kiev regime, as weapons from there end up across the continent via black markets and fall into the hands of militants."

Western nations have not abandoned their aspirations to "tear" Belarus away from Russia and are preparing for a revanche in the republic: "They appear to be waiting for an opportune moment."

A violent overthrow of power in Belarus "would nullify all integration achievements" and create a hotspot of instability on Russia’s borders.

Russia and Belarus do not intend to stand idly by and watch the West’s attempts to destabilize the situation in the country.

The intention of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas to compile a list of demands for Russia within the framework of the Ukrainian settlement once again demonstrates "the European bureaucracy’s determination to prevent an end to hostilities by any means."

It is the EU that is preventing Ukraine from reaching any compromises towards a settlement, "by promising to provide everything necessary for the continuation of combat operations."

The rhetoric, insults, and unending stream of falsehoods from Europeans make it impossible "to even consider them acceptable not just as negotiators, but as neighbours at the table" on Ukrainian settlement.

Few other European states undermine Russia-US negotiation efforts as much as France.

There is every reason to believe that behind French President Emmanuel Macron’s statements lies not a desire to negotiate, but rather an intent to interject himself and his demands into the negotiation process.

Russia will work towards the full-fledged reinstatement of the Russian Olympic Committee and the restoration of Russian athletes’ rights in the global sports arena. Approximately 70 international sports federations already allow adult athletes from Russia to compete internationally. Youth athletes have once again been granted the opportunity to compete under the national flag and to the tune of the country’s anthem.

Russian diplomats are providing all necessary assistance to compatriots in Cuba to facilitate their return home: "We are, of course, also in contact with all government authorities, ministries, and agencies of the Russian government to resolve this situation and provide assistance to Russian citizens."

External forces are "seeking to worsen the energy crisis in Cuba" and to cancel air service to the island republic.

The Foreign Ministry advises Russian nationals "to take the current circumstances" and risks into account and to carefully monitor recommendations regarding Cuba.

The stated desire of Macron to hold a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin has not progressed "beyond words."

France is acting as the "flagship of the anti-Russian course" in Europe, actively promoting the myth of a Russian threat not only to Russia but, allegedly, to all of Western Europe.

The French leadership unilaterally broke off all ties. "The rejection of dialogue was not our choice, but a decision by the French leadership, which, of course, is entirely entitled to determine its own actions."

Moscow "harbours no illusions" about Paris’s desire to restore ties. "Therefore, we prefer to judge former partners not by words and promises, but by their actions," Zakharova said.

Moscow has emphasized to Tokyo that Russian sovereignty over the Kuril Islands is non-negotiable: "Russia’s legitimate sovereignty over the Kuril Islands was determined by the outcome of the Second World War and is enshrined in the Russian Constitution."

French President Emmanuel Macron  said he had only just become aware of the affair.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 08:19 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 08:19 AM

ALDEN BIESEN, Belgium - President Emmanuel Macron on Feb 12 said “something should have been done” earlier about a French diplomat who was investigated in the US for allegedly viewing child pornography and features in the Epstein files.

According to documents consulted by AFP, Mr

Fabrice Aidan’s name appears more than 200 times

The first email exchanges between Mr Aidan and Epstein date back to 2010, when the former represented France at the United Nations.

A mere mention in the files from the investigation into the disgraced New York financier does not imply wrongdoing.

Mr Macron, asked on Feb 12 how the diplomat could still be working in the service, said it was “unacceptable”.

“If it’s true that the administration had information several years ago, then something should have been done,” he added.

Mr Macron said he had only just become aware of the affair.

News websites 20 Minutes and Mediapart reported on Feb 10 that in the US, the FBI had in 2013 opened an investigation into Mr Aidan for viewing child pornography.

His lawyer said that Mr Aidan denied “the entirety of the accusations made against him”.

Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot has reported the latest findings on Mr Aidan to the French justice system, which has opened an administrative inquiry and a disciplinary procedure.

Mr Macron speaking to journalists in Belgium, where he was attending a summit, said he had asked Mr Barrot to find out “how, given what was apparently known, measures weren’t taken earlier”, he added.

Mr Aidan worked at the United Nations between 2006 and 2013.

After UN headquarters in New York, he went on to work for the UN cultural agency UNESCO.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence.

He killed himself in prison in 2019

Sidney Crosby and Drew Doughty were Canada's only players with Olympic experience. Everyone else, from Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon to Jordan Binnington and Macklin Celebrini, was making his debut on sport's biggest stage.

What a first impression they made.

Celebrini scored Canada's first goal in the NHL's return to the Games, Binnington stopped all 26 shots he faced and Canada defeated Czechia 5-0 on Thursday, showing the tournament favorite is already a well-oiled machine.

“Our intentions were really good with the way we played,” said Crosby, who along with Doughty was part of gold-medal wins in 2010 and '14. “I thought we were physical. We were moving our feet. The execution, sometimes that comes with time. But even other times we did some good things and executed well. Just a matter of building off of that.”

Celebrini, his country’s youngest player at 19, deflected a shot by Cale Makar past Lukas Dostal with 5.7 seconds left in the first, putting an exclamation point on a terrific, back-and-forth period. After Mitch Marner’s saucer pass to Mark Stone for his goal and Bo Horvat’s on a breakaway later in the second, Czechia never stood a chance.

“I don’t care who anybody is, whether you’re Sid to Doughty to Celebrini, when you’re playing in the Olympics for the first time, it never gets old, and everybody’s got their jitters,” coach Jon Cooper said. “You know what I liked? I thought we got better as that game went on. ... I thought as that game went on, we got a little bit more controlled."

The handful of times Binnington got tested, he was there to make the save. Before Celebrini scored, Binnington kept it 0-0 by making a left-pad stop on Michal Kempny and reaching out to smother David Kampf’s rebound attempt.

“Felt good," Binnington said. “Every team, every country has some star players, so we know they’re going to come at some point. And I think we did a good job holding them down and letting me see pucks, getting me access to play my game.”

At the other end of the ice, Dostal played well but was helpless to slow down much of the onslaught. There was nothing he could do on the Sidney Crosby to Connor McDavid to Nathan MacKinnon tic-tac-toe power-play goal in the third period.

“Two of the best players ever to play passing it to me is cool,” MacKinnon said. "I didn’t do much for that one. Just blessed to be on the back side. Anyone would have put that in.”

The same trio combined for almost the same goal in opening game of the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago. Canada won that Olympic appetizer by beating the U.S. — which opens Thursday night against Latvia — in overtime.

McDavid had three assists, including one on Nick Suzuki’s goal that made it 5-0. The three-time NHL MVP, who's considered the best hockey player in the world, liked how Canada plays but also thinks this isn't peak performance.

“It was good," McDavid said. "A lot of good things. A lot of things we can improve on as well.”

Adding NHL talent to a group that made a deep run in an international tournament last spring, Switzerland opened the Olympics with a statement victory against France.

Timo Meier of the New Jersey Devils scored twice in the third period, 39-year-old national team goaltender Leonardo Genoni stopped all 27 shots he faced and Switzerland shut out France 4-0. Damien Riat scored 55 seconds in, J.J. Moser of the Tampa Bay Lightning made it a two-goal lead three minutes in and there wasn't much to worry about the rest of the way.

“It helps you a lot if you score two in the first, whatever it was, five minutes,” Moser said. "It just gives you a little bit more comfort, more confidence also for the rest of the game.”

The goals by Meier put the game out of reach after he and his teammates tilted the ice toward Keller. Meier called it “a mature performance there how we put the game away.”

With a boisterous contingent of fans in attendance, Switzerland outshot France 43-27 and sent them home happy.

A part of that was the play in net of Genoni, the 38-year-old who backstopped his country on an improbable run to the final at the world championships last spring before losing 1-0 to the U.S. in overtime. Genoni, who was tournament MVP with a 0.99 goals-against average and 0.953 save percentage, wasn't sweating getting a shutout and is more worried about the rest of the Olympics.

“It’s a great start,” Genoni said. “We had a really, really good start into the game and could shut the door behind. It’s a perfect start for us.”

Switzerland next plays Canada on Friday.

“Obviously a big team coming up," forward Nino Niederreiter said. "We’re going to try our best to poke the bear a little bit and see if we can go from there.”

The Union government’s Defence Acquisition Council on Thursday approved proposals to buy several military equipment, including additional Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force.

The council, which reports to the defence ministry and is headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, granted the acceptance of necessity for proposals worth Rs 3.6 lakh crore. The proposals included the purchase of combat missiles and an airship-based high-altitude pseudo-satellite.

The majority of the Rafale aircraft being ordered will be manufactured in India, the ministry said.

Procuring more Rafales will “enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles” and boost the Air Force’s deterrence capabilities, “with long-range offensive strikes”, it added.

While the defence ministry did not state the number of Rafales being purchased, news reports widely said it would be 114, with 90 being manufactured in India. Some of the remaining jets are likely to be acquired in fly-away condition to meet the Air Force’s immediate operational needs.

The withdrawal of the last two MiG-21 squadrons in September had dropped the Air Force’s combat squadron strength to 29, against the 42 sanctioned in 2012. A fighting squadron typically has 16 to 18 jets.

The fresh purchase of the Rafale aircraft was cleared days ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Delhi between February 17 and February 19. The Rafales are manufactured by the French firm Dassault Aviation.

The Air Force already operates the Rafales. The deal to procure 36 of them was signed by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government in 2016 at a cost of Rs 58,000 crore.

The Congress had accused the Narendra Modi government of corruption. The Centre has denied the allegations.

The Opposition party had also alleged at the time that the Modi government had helped a defence firm owned by industrialist Anil Ambani land a major contract under the deal even though it had no experience in the sector. Ambani has denied the allegations.


On Thursday, the defence ministry said that the combat missiles being procured are meant to enhance the Air Force’s stand-off ground attack capability “with deep strike power and very high accuracy”.

The air-ship based high-altitude pseudo satellite, the ministry said, will be used by the military for surveillance and reconnaissance, electronic intelligence, communications and remote sensing.

For the Indian Navy, the council cleared the acquisition of additional Boeing P-8I Poseidon aircraft, which are meant for long-range maritime reconnaissance. The acquisition will also boost the Navy’s long-range anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, the ministry said.

The purchase of six P8I aircraft had been cleared, The Indian Express reported. The Indian Navy already operates 12 P-8Is.

For the Indian Army, the council approved the procurement of anti-tank mines named Vibhav, and overhaul of armoured recovery vehicles, T-72 tanks and infantry combat vehicles to increase their service life.

The proposals cleared by the council are required to get a final approval from the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is headed by the prime minister.

In April, India had signed a deal with France to buy 26 Rafale Marine fighter aircraft for the Indian Navy at a cost of about Rs 64,000 crore. The Rafale Marine is an aircraft carrier-borne fighter jet.

Today’s key headlines cover India’s defence expansion with Rafale and P-8I acquisitions, Budget debates in Parliament, Bangladesh’s election results, a major Gulf high-speed rail project, and more.

India is set to strengthen its defence capabilities with the acquisition of advanced fighter jets from France and additional maritime surveillance aircraft. The move includes the procurement of Rafale fighter jets and P-8I submarine hunter aircraft to enhance air and naval preparedness.

A Joint Committee of Parliament on the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, which aims to establish a Higher Education Commission with three councils to handle regulatory, standard-setting and accreditation functions, will now present its report in the last week of the Monsoon Session.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held a meeting with US Ambassador Sergio Gor in New Delhi on Thursday, after which the latter said that with the finalisation of the trade deal, many opportunities are poised to open up for the India-US partnership. This comes on a day when New Delhi has categorically said that the joint statement released by both sides on February 7 remains the basis for the interim trade agreement.

In the Rajya Sabha, Opposition leaders criticised the government’s Budget, raising concerns over support for farmers and questioning the long-term economic roadmap. The debate focused on policy direction and welfare measures during the Rajya Sabha discussion on Budget and farmers’ issues.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landslide parliamentary election on Friday, local TV stations showed, securing a resounding mandate in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the South Asian nation.

The Enforcement Directorate has summoned former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his son Raninder Singh for questioning in connection with a case linked to the alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, PTI quoted unidentified officials as saying on Wednesday.

The two men have been accused of being beneficiaries of foreign assets, including a Swiss bank account.

While the central agency summoned Amarinder Singh, who is a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, to its Jalandhar office on Thursday, his son was asked to depose the next day, the officials told the news agency.

However, Amarinder Singh is unlikely to depose on February 12 as he had undergone a knee replacement surgery in Mohali on Tuesday and was recovering, The Indian Express reported.

However, Raninder Singh said in a social media post on Wednesday: “As law-abiding citizens, we will cooperate fully with every investigation agency. We have absolute faith in the rule of law and are confident that truth and justice will prevail.”

The matter stems from “credible” information and “master sheets” received by the Indian government from the French government in 2011, which claimed that the two men were beneficiaries of foreign assets that were maintained and controlled through foreign business entities, PTI reported.

This included a Swiss bank account and an asset in Dubai held through a trust.

In November 2016, the Income Tax Department filed a prosecution complaint, or a chargesheet, against Amarinder Singh and Raninder Singh in the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Ludhiana under sections of the Indian Penal Code, including prosecution for making false statements or producing false accounts/documents.

At the time, Amarinder Singh was part of the Congress. He left the party in 2022 after being removed as chief minister and subsequently joined the BJP.

The complaint filed in November 2016 in the magistrate court had cited data that was received by the Indian government from 2011, first from France and then from Dubai, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands, The Indian Express reported.

Text: 





















I understand one of the reasons why young working women prefer other forms of attire to the sari – it takes time and effort to drape a sari right. Nevertheless, there are ways around this problem. Mothers in the 1990s got tailors to pre-stitch the pleats of a sari, so that their young ladies could zip it up and throw the pallu over their shoulder. Voila! The young girls were ready for Diwali, temple or puja functions, or graduation and dance recitals. Gen Z relies on these instant, pre-draped saris that I continue to supply to my daughters and now to my granddaughter.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that most young men interviewed appreciated the sari’s cultural and civilisational worth as opposed to thinking it reflected the wearer’s conservative temperament or her wanting to fit into societal expectations of so-called modesty or good character. They thought saris were beautiful and gorgeous, the soul of Indian culture, and felt that young women wearing it looked “crazy pretty”, “no less than a goddess”, and some even said it’s one of the sexiest dresses they would like their girlfriends or wives to wear.

The Gen Z women interviewed could be divided into those determined to go forward and even lead a growing Gen Z movement to reembrace and reinvent the sari for the twenty-first century and those who viewed it with some scepticism. As noted, many of them were intimidated by the time and effort required to drape a sari properly and were loath to learn how to do it properly. Others found it cumbersome for an active lifestyle, for mobility and work. It is also because regrettably, it is no longer a rite of passage among many households to teach and learn how to drape a sari.

Then there is the matter of how cool it is to wear a sari. Some seemed to think that wearing a sari somehow dockets them into the less sophisticated category of youth, or portrays them as coming from conservative, less cosmopolitan family backgrounds. Fortunately, there are self-assured young women who consider it super cool to wear a sari and favour it as a confidence booster, one that flatters you, and makes you look elegant and attractive.

My survey of these young women showed their appreciation of the sari went up if it was validated by their boyfriends, husbands, and others. Others donned saris to be taken seriously in professional, academic, and social situations, to look older and more mature, especially if they were petite and looked too young.

Some OTT shows, barring the period dramas, portray liberated young women characters wearing Western-style bare essentials rather than saris. The Indian take on Sex and the City – Four More Shots Please – on Amazon Prime has been, I am told, a trendsetter for both professional women and those privileged women who don’t have to work for a living to follow their designer dress code which mostly excludes saris. Among other shows popular with Gen Z, such as Made in Heaven, about wedding planners, the sari gets to play a role, like in shows like The Royals on Netflix and Kull on JioHotsar, about the struggles of Rajasthani royal families to brand their traditional lifestyle, which includes the sari, to make a living in the present.

Fortunately, social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and X have become vehicles of awakening millennials to the importance of the sari in their lives. Recent surveys have noted that the sari has been experiencing a resurgence among Gen Z as a result and has enabled a re-imagination of its narrative.

Travel and lifestyle influencer Larissa D’sa has been skateboarding in a sari and sneakers.

Influencer Natasha Thasan (with roots in Sri Lanka, but with a global following) releases one-minute-long Instagram videos that she calls “drape therapy”, in which she talks about her life while draping a sari.

In making “drape therapy” a trend, Gen Z is wrapping mental health in fashion. I was moved by what one college student, a sari aficionado, said on the sari’s therapeutic power as a comforting garment that feels like a hug, like being held gently and in peace. It’s more than getting dressed – it’s a small way of coming home to yourself. She could well be me expressing this!

Sagrika Rai, founder of the sari brand Warp ’n Weft, told The ESTD, “Gen Z is about 50% of our customer base; the bigger the occasion, the bigger the spend.” #SariTwitter and #SariNotSorry are popular hashtags on X, where women share their photos in saris. The sari has also found its way onto Etsy through the hands of a few visionary creators. Now, with its first order from France, the epicentre of haute couture, it begins to cross continents, as attire, as a refined expression of India’s evolving sartorial voice and renewed excellence.

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 12:10 AM

Feb 12 - France and Germany are among European countries that have shown interest in a new land-based ballistic missile proposed by aerospace firm ArianeGroup, the latest sign of Europe's push to close its deep-strike weapons gap.

The French defence ministry is in talks with ArianeGroup about the system, according to the company, which says the missile could hit targets more than 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) away within minutes. It said it is also in contact with the German government and providing information on the capability.

"People are trying to understand what is at stake with ballistic systems," Vincent Pery, ArianeGroup's director of defence programmes, told journalists on Thursday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

He said the company is holding "preliminary discussions with several countries" about how the weapon would fit into the geopolitical context, citing Russia's ballistic missile strikes on Ukraine, and the use of such weapons in the Middle East.

Germany's defence ministry had no immediate comment. France's defence ministry did not immediately respond.

KEEPING UP WITH RUSSIA

Germany and France are among countries that have raised defence spending since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and as U.S. President Donald Trump made clear Europeans should expect less support from NATO's leading military power.

Russia's growing missile use has prompted some European nations to explore their own options to strike deep into enemy territory.

Last month, Russia used its intermediate-range Oreshnik ballistic missile for the second time in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has said it is impossible to intercept due to its reported speed of more than 10 times the speed of sound.

"We are within range of these missiles," French President Emmanuel Macron said last month, arguing Europe must develop comparable weapons to deter Russia and secure the continent. France's budget proposed up to one billion euros for a ground-based ballistic-missile programme.

Still, Europe is years away from fielding such a weapon, said Zuzanna Gwadera, a research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. She said the region's various deep-strike initiatives, which could also include cruise missiles, remain largely at the conceptual stage.

France is currently the only European NATO member with a domestically developed ballistic-missile programme: the M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile built by ArianeGroup, Europe's biggest maker of space launchers.

The company, co-owned by Airbus and Safran, said it could leverage its expertise to deliver a land-based conventional ballistic missile within years. REUTERS

Text: Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference this week

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation this week to the Munich Security Conference where increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump’s often inconsistent policies and threats that have roiled transatlantic relations and the post-World War II international order.

A year after Vice President JD Vance stunned assembled dignitaries at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America’s closest allies in Europe, accusing them of imperiling Western civilization with left-leaning domestic programs and not taking responsibility for their own defense, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering of world leaders and national security officials Saturday, U.S. officials say.

The State Department’s formal announcement of Rubio’s trip offered no details about his two-day stop in Munich, after which he will visit Slovakia and Hungary. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the trip, said America's top diplomat intends to focus on areas of cooperation on shared global and regional concerns, including in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as China, an economic powerhouse seeking to take advantage of the uncertainty in U.S.-European ties.

Should that be the case, many in the audience may be relieved after being buffeted first by Vance’s blunt rebukes last year and then a series of Trump statements and moves in the months since that have targeted virtually every country in Europe, Canada and long-standing allies in the Indo-Pacific.

Trump’s recent comments about taking control of Greenland from NATO member Denmark and insults hurled at various leaders were particularly unnerving, leading many in Europe to question the value of the U.S. as an ally and partner.

That leaves Rubio with a heavy lift if he wants to calm the waters.

Vance's speech last year was “really a shock moment,” said Claudia Major, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “It was perceived as the first very clear statement of what the new Trump administration was about," namely that “Europeans are not partners any longer.”

“There is a big doubt whether the basis (of trust) is still there and whether we still share the same vision for the trans-Atlantic relationship,” she said. “The longer this kind of estrangement goes, the more difficult it will be to re-find a solid relationship.”

Munich Security Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger offered a similar view.

“Transatlantic relations are currently in a significant crisis of confidence and credibility,” he said this week. But he also expressed hope that Rubio and the dozens of U.S. lawmakers expected to attend the meeting will offer a less dire and dour prognosis for the future.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whom Rubio will meet Friday, has tried to adopt a middle line to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and insistence on transactional relations.

He said Europe also needs to “learn the language of power politics” to assert itself, for example, by taking greater responsibility for its security, striving for greater “technological independence” and boosting its economic growth. But he stressed that “as democracies, we are partners and allies and not subordinates” of the U.S.

Some, like French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, appear to have all but given up on Trump and the United States. Both Canada and France opened consulates in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, last week in a show of support for both Greenland and Denmark.

Macron warned this week that tensions between Europe and the U.S. could intensify after the recent “Greenland moment.” He described the Trump administration as “openly anti-European” and seeking the European Union’s “dismemberment."

“When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” he said in an interview with several European newspapers. “I think we’ve tried that strategy for months. It’s not working.”

Macron noted a “double crisis: We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side.”

Carney — who drew applause from many for pushing back against Trump in a speech last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland — has made no secret of his frustration and impatience with the Republican president.

Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. He vowed to pursue trade deals with countries other than the U.S., including China, to serve as anchors of commercial stability. The China deal drew new threats from Trump.

For many in Europe, Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland exacerbate their fears over Russia’s war with Ukraine and serve as a reminder of centuries of power politics in which diplomacy was subordinate to the use of military force.

“Greenland is to Trump as, essentially, Ukraine is to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, although obviously without the devastating war at this stage,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term in office.

In the meantime, as Trump tries to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and seek a nuclear deal with Iran, Europeans are increasingly uneasy about Trump’s “Board of Peace,” a 27-member group of world leaders tasked first with handling the Gaza peace agreement but eventually envisaged as a vehicle for resolving other major conflicts.

Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden, among others, have either declined to accept or have not yet signed on to the board, which will hold its first meeting to raise money for Gaza in Washington on Feb. 19.

</entities>
Text: India may be home to centuries-old love poetry, temple carvings celebrating intimacy, and the world’s most quoted ancient text on desire,  but when it comes to modern relationship satisfaction, the picture is more complex.

According to the Ipsos Valentine’s Day survey, conducted across 29 global markets, India ranks lowest in partner satisfaction and sits among the bottom three countries on the Love Life Satisfaction Index 2026.

Reason? “There is a notable gap between relationship expectations and lived experiences among Indian respondents,” reveals the survey.

The Love Life Satisfaction Index is not a vague, feel-good metric. It combines three specific dimensions: satisfaction with the love in one’s life, satisfaction with one’s sex life, and satisfaction with one’s relationship with a spouse or partner.

In other words, it attempts to measure not just romance or chemistry, but emotional connection, physical intimacy and relational stability together. And here’s where the paradox begins.

Two in three Indians (67%) describe their relationship with their spouse or partner as loving. That’s not a small number. In absolute terms, a majority report positive emotional connection.

Yet when compared globally, India ranks lowest on partner satisfaction. It also falls among the bottom three markets when respondents were asked whether they feel loved.

That gap — between “my relationship is loving” and “I feel loved” — may be subtle, but it is significant. It hints at something deeper than relationship status: perceived emotional reciprocity.

Ipsos India CEO Suresh Ramalingam cautions against reading the findings as a crisis. “Two in three Indians report being satisfied with their love life. The ranking is relative across markets and should be interpreted in context,” he notes.

India’s ranking feels jarring against its global image. The land of the Kamasutra, Bollywood romance and elaborate wedding rituals is culturally synonymous with passion and intimacy.

But modern love doesn’t unfold in mythology.

Multi-generational family systems, rising work pressures, dual-income households, shifting gender roles and evolving expectations within marriages may all shape how people experience emotional fulfilment today. Balancing caregiving, careers and partnership leaves less space for overt affirmation — even if affection exists. Love may be present. But is it felt and expressed?

Interestingly, India performs far better when it comes to romance and sex life satisfaction. The country ranks 8th overall among 29 markets on this dimension — ahead of several Western nations.

Thailand and Indonesia lead the category, followed by Mexico, Spain, Malaysia, Colombia, Peru, India and Argentina.

This contrast suggests something important: emotional validation and physical intimacy do not always move together. People may feel reasonably satisfied with romance and sexual connection, yet still report lower levels of feeling emotionally affirmed.

Thailand tops the overall Love Life Satisfaction Index in 2026, with respondents reporting high satisfaction across all three dimensions. Countries across Asia, Latin America and parts of Europe dominate the upper tier.

At the bottom sit Japan, South Korea and India. Even Italy and France — long associated with romance — appear in the bottom ten, proving that cultural stereotypes don’t always mirror lived experience.

Across 29 markets, income appears to influence love life satisfaction. Eighty-two per cent of high-income respondents say they are satisfied with the love in their life, compared to 72% of low-income respondents. When it comes to romantic and sex life satisfaction, the gap widens to 14 percentage points.

Money may not buy love, but financial stability seems to reduce stressors that strain relationships. The survey, based on over 23,000 respondents globally, including around 2,200 in India, ultimately reveals that love is multi-dimensional. Emotional fulfilment, romance and physical intimacy are distinct — and sometimes misaligned. For India, the findings are less about a deficit of love and more about evolving expectations. In a rapidly changing society, how love is expressed — and how it is perceived — may be shifting just as quickly.

Authors of the draft legislation say it is needed to protect children from cyberbullying, harmful content and predatory individuals.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 05:55 AM


LISBON - Portugal’s Parliament on Feb 3 approved a Bill, on its first reading, requiring explicit parental consent for children aged 13 to 16 to access social media, in one of the first concrete legislative moves in Europe to impose such restrictions.

Authors of the draft legislation from the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) say it is needed to protect children from cyberbullying, harmful content and predatory individuals.

A public system known as Digital Mobile Key (DMK) will be used by parents to give consent, also helping to enforce the existing ban for children under the age of 13 to access digital social media, video- and image-sharing platforms, or online betting sites.

Tech providers are also required to implement an age verification system compatible with the DMK.

The Bill, approved by 148-69 votes with 13 abstentions, can still be modified before the final vote.

France’s Lower House in January

backed legislation to ban children under 15

Australia’s world-first ban for under-16s

The Portuguese Bill says it will fill a regulatory gap that has allowed “multinational digital platforms to set rules unilaterally”, affecting children’s cognitive and emotional development, particularly with early or excessive exposure.

It says that over the past two decades, social media have assumed roles long held by families and schools without regulation.

“We have to protect our children... we don’t intend to prohibit for the sake of prohibiting, we intend to create a norm to give more power to parents and families, to accompany and control,” PSD lawmaker Paulo Marcelo said before the vote.

He said that tech companies ignoring the restrictions could face fines of up to 2 per cent of their global revenue. REUTERS

Text: Austria and Germany have joined France in calling for the resignation of United Nations Special Rapporteur for the "Occupied Palestinian Territories" Francesca Albanese following her recent remarks calling Israel the "common enemy of humanity."

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul condemned Albanese’s statements.

“I respect the system of independent UN rapporteurs. However, Ms. Albanese has repeatedly made outbursts in the past. I condemn her recent statements about Israel. She is untenable in her position," Wadephul said.

Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger likewise criticized the Special Rapporteur.

"Francesca Albanese broadly brands Israel as an ‘enemy of humanity.’ Criticism of Israel’s conduct is legitimate, and Austria has always called for compliance with international law. But Albanese is spreading incitement. Such language undermines the impartiality and highest standards required of a UN representative. Ms. Albanese has unfortunately repeatedly failed to meet these standards," Meinl-Reisinger stated.

The French government previously called for Albanese to step down after she stated that Israel is the "common enemy" of humankind. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told lawmakers that France "unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks made by Ms. Francesca Albanese, which are directed not at the Israeli government, whose policies may be criticized, but at Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable."

Barrot said Albanese's remarks "add to a long list of scandalous positions, justifying October 7, the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust, mentioning the Jewish lobby or comparing Israel to the Third Reich." More than 20 French MPs demanded that Albanese be removed from her position following her remarks at an Al Jazeera conference.

In remarks delivered at the Al Jazeera conference, Albanese said: “The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support ... We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy."

Title: “I don’t agree with luxury brands that hide the ‘Made in India’ label”: Italian designer Elio Ferraro who presents his collection in Mumbai

Text: For one evening, the Italian luxury furniture showroom Poltrona Frau in Ballard Estate transformed into a fashion house as acclaimed Italian designer Elio Ferraro presented his ‘Gate to India’ collection. The showcase was hosted by the Consul General of Italy, Walter Ferrara.

The collection featured about 35 pieces — dresses, lehengas, blouses, ponchos, kaftans, and jackets layered over silk saris by Kaysons — embellished with beads, zardozi, embroidery, crystals and sequins of various shapes and sizes. A revered name in Indian textiles, Kaysons, which started in 1932 in Lucknow before coming to Mumbai in 1980s, provided the foundational fabrics that Ferraro’s visionary designs transformed.

At the crescendo stood a one-piece dress inspired by India’s national bird, the peacock: the bodice shimmered in deep purple and green sequins, while the skirt incorporated actual peacock feathers.

The collection is a direct outcome of the Sicily-born designer’s long engagement with India. Ferraro has been travelling to the country for nearly a decade, immersing himself in its crafts and textiles. He speaks particularly admiringly of Banaras, which he compares to Italy’s Como and France’s Lyon for its silk textile heritage calling them “world’s three silk capitals”. In his collection on display, he has incorporated Banarasi brocade silk prominently.

Moving from Sicily to Florence and onto the global stage, Ferraro found in India not just inspiration but a creative partner. “The choice of ‘Gate to India’ as the title of this collection expresses my gratitude to a country that has become my alternative professional headquarters over the past few years,” said Ferraro, who has held design positions at Emilio Pucci and Salvatore Ferragamo. As is his practice, the collection comprises entirely unique pieces, a philosophy that has attracted celebrities including Rihanna and Victoria Beckham.

Handwork, he emphasised, is central to his practice. “Crystals, sequins and other materials are always applied individually. Embroideries are developed with patience and precision. Time is an essential component of each piece,” he said. Paisley motifs, a symbol deeply rooted in Indian heritage, recur throughout the embroidery. The pattern, he says, has travelled across cultures for centuries in his work and becomes a point of connection between India and the Mediterranean.

Emphasising that the value of a garment lies not only in how it looks, but in how it is made, he said: “To me, luxury is represented by uniqueness, not price. My meticulous search for the highest quality, achieved through the work of experienced craftsmen, is the focus of my practice, and I believe India is the ideal country in the world to achieve that.”

Ferraro also expressed disagreement with luxury brands that obscure Indian craftsmanship. “I do not agree with those so-called luxury brands that hide the ‘Made in India’ label, finishing products elsewhere and then stating ‘Made in France’ or wherever,” he said, adding that he has been working with craftsman since the beginning of his Indian journey and proudly credits them. “This collection is dedicated to India and its beautiful textile and craft.”

The evening extended beyond fashion into cultural diplomacy. “This event embodies the essence of our diplomatic mission — to build bridges not just of trade, but of shared vision and human connection,” said Consul General of Italy, Walter Ferrara. “When Elio Ferraro’s Sicilian spirit dialogues with India’s master weavers, we witness not just a collection, but the future of Indo-Italian relations.”

Text: Switzerland will hold a referendum on a proposal to cap the rich Alpine country’s population at 10 million

GENEVA -- Switzerland will hold a referendum on a proposal to cap the rich Alpine country's population at 10 million, the latest bid by the top right-wing party to limit immigration. Passage could trigger a new showdown with its European neighbors.

Proponents of the initiative, led by the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party that has the most seats in parliament, tallied enough petition signatures to put the issue on national ballots on June 14, the government said Wednesday.

The federal statistics office says Switzerland had 9.1 million people as of the end of the third quarter of 2025. Traditionally, people born abroad have made up about 30% of that in recent years. Most have come from European Union countries. Some have taken Swiss citizenship.

The proposal would enshrine into law rules that Switzerland's permanent resident population — both Swiss citizens and foreigners with residency papers — must not exceed 10 million before 2050.

If the population reaches 9.5 million before then the government would take steps to limit it such as through measures on asylum, family reunification, residency permit issuance and renegotiating international agreements.

The idea, proponents say, would be to help protect the environment, natural resources, infrastructure and the social safety net from strains of population growth.

The vote is part of Switzerland’s direct democracy that gives voters a direct say in policymaking, usually four times a year, through the ballot box.

For years, the party — known as SVP by its German-language acronym — has sought to curb a rise in migration into the rich Alpine country with mixedresults. Many other Western countries have seen rising anti-immigration sentiment too.

Critics — across much of the rest of the political spectrum — say the proposal oversimplifies a complex issue: namely that Switzerland benefits from its ties to its neighbors, especially four bordering EU countries Austria, France, Germany and Italy.

For example, they say Switzerland often relies on foreign workers at hospitals, hotels, construction sites and universities, and any such restrictions on migration and free movement of people would violate Switzerland’s existing international commitments.

Switzerland is part of Europe's Schengen zone, created over four decades ago, that today brings together some 29 countries that allow visa-free circulation. Most are European Union members: Switzerland, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are not. The area brings together some 450 million people.

Text: The Paris prosecutors office on Thursday said that nine people were being detained as part of an investigation into a suspected decade-long, 10 million euro ($11.8 million) ticket fraud scheme at the Louvre, the world’s most visited museum.

The arrests took place on Tuesday as part of a judicial investigation opened after the Louvre filed a complaint in December 2024, the prosecutors’ office said.

The loss for the museum over the past decade is estimated to exceed 10 million euros ($11.8 million), it said.

Those detained include two Louvre employees, several tour guides and one person suspected of being the mastermind, according to the prosecutors’ office.

The museum alerted investigators about the frequent presence of two Chinese tour guides suspected of bringing groups of Chinese tourists into the museum by fraudulently reusing the same tickets multiple times for different visitors.

Other guides were later suspected of similar practices.

The prosecutors’ office said surveillance and wiretaps confirmed repeated ticket reuse and an apparent strategy of splitting up tour groups to avoid paying the required “speaking fee” imposed on guides.

The investigation also pointed to suspected accomplices within the Louvre, with guides allegedly paying them cash in exchange for avoiding ticket checks, it said.

A formal judicial investigation was opened in June last year on charges including organized fraud, money laundering, corruption, aiding illegal entry in the country as part of an organized group, and the use of forged administrative documents.

Investigators believe the network may have brought in up to 20 tour groups a day over the past decade.

Suspects are believed to have invested some of the money in real estate in France and Dubai.

Authorities have seized more than 957,000 euros ($1.13 million) in cash, including 67,000 euros ($79,459) in foreign currency, as well as 486,000 euros ($576,374) from bank accounts.





The prosecutors’ office mentioned a similar ticket fraud is also suspected to have taken place at the Palace of Versailles, without providing further details.

In October, the crown jewels robbery at the Louvre drew worldwide attention to the museum, after a team of four people broke in through a window during visiting hours and fled with an estimated 88 million euros ($104 million) worth of treasures.

Authorities have arrested several suspects in that case, but the stolen items remain missing.

Additional charges on overnight stays could add more than £100 to the cost of a typical family break

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing mounting pressure from the hospitality industry after approximately 200 major accommodation businesses demanded she abandon controversial plans for a so-called "holiday tax" in England.

Leading firms have signed an open letter coordinated by trade body UKHospitality urging the Government to drop the proposed visitor levy.

The industry chiefs warned that the additional charges on overnight stays could add more than £100 to the cost of a typical family break.

The firms that signed the open letter include Butlin's, Hilton, Travelodge, Haven and Merlin Entertainments, which operates Legoland and the London Eye.

According to UKHospitality's calculations, a levy of just £2 per person per night would increase the bill for a family of four taking a fortnight's summer holiday by £112.

"Holidays are for relaxing, not taxing," the business leaders told Ms Reeves in their letter, arguing the measure would disproportionately burden families.

The proposed levy was confirmed during last year's autumn budget, when Ms Reeves announced that regional mayors across England would be granted powers to impose charges on overnight accommodation including hotels, Airbnbs and holiday lets.

The scheme follows similar measures already devolved to Scotland and Wales, with the intention of providing local leaders with additional funding for infrastructure and transport improvements.

Several mayors have already signalled their enthusiasm for the new powers. Both London and Liverpool have indicated they plan to introduce levies once the legislation takes effect.

The charges would apply across various types of paid accommodation, from major hotel chains to bed and breakfasts and holiday parks.

Industry figures have expressed alarm that the tax could also affect business travellers attending conferences and meetings, potentially driving up costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers.

The accommodation bosses cautioned that families would bear the brunt of the new charges, with many forced to cut short their breaks, abandon holiday plans entirely, or look overseas for better value.

"This 'Holiday Tax' will hit families hardest, puts jobs at risk, drain money from local businesses and communities and undermine the Government's growth agenda," the letter stated.

The signatories raised particular concerns about coastal areas heavily dependent on tourism for employment. Fewer visitors would translate into reduced shifts and diminished opportunities, especially for entry-level workers and those returning to employment, they argued.

Beyond accommodation providers, the ripple effects would damage restaurants, cafes, pubs, taxi firms and shops that rely on tourist spending to survive.

"In many places, it is tourist spending which keeps high streets alive, supporting the small businesses that define our communities," the letter warned.

The hospitality sector is already grappling with significant financial pressures beyond the proposed levy. Business rates for hotels are set to surge dramatically, with analysis by UKHospitality suggesting average bills will rise by 115 per cent over the coming three years, adding more than £205,000 to typical costs.

While pubs secured a 15 per cent discount on their business rates following industry outcry last month, hotels and other accommodation providers were excluded from the relief measures.

Rising energy costs, increased employment expenses and higher National Insurance contributions have compounded the sector's difficulties.

The letter noted that UK hospitality already pays VAT at 20 per cent, double the rate charged by competitors in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

A Government spokesman defended the plans, stating: "We expect any new charges to be modest and in line with other countries, and it is for mayors to consider the right level for their area."

A poll in January found that Mr Bruno Retailleau was the most popular possible right-wing candidate among supporters of his camp.


Published Feb 13, 2026, 01:56 AM


PARIS - A former interior minister of France who heads the country’s right-wing Republicans party, Mr Bruno Retailleau, announced on Feb 12 he will run in the 2027 presidential election, vowing to hold a referendum on the hot-button issue of immigration if elected.

Mr Retailleau, 65, is the latest heavyweight to join the race, in which current President Emmanuel Macron will not be running having reached his two-term limit.

“I have decided to run for president,” he said in a speech as he announced his candidacy, vowing “to refuse to leave our country in the state it is in today”.

“I don’t want to be president of the Republic out of an obsession of power, but sense of duty,” he added.

“To confront the world’s disorder, our country must first put its own house in order.”

Mr Retailleau, who stepped down as interior minister in October, is vying to reignite political momentum as the right’s natural presidential candidate with a tough-on-crime and anti-immigration stance.

Addressing his fellow party lawmakers in a letter seen by AFP earlier on Feb 12, Mr Retailleau said it was “a decision I have thought through carefully”.

“The time has come for my political family to show the French a new path, focused on order, prosperity, and French pride,” he wrote.

“I’m ready to lead this project, but this adventure can only be a collective one,” he said.

A poll in January found that Mr Retailleau was the most popular possible right-wing candidate among supporters of his camp.

During his stint as interior minister from 2024 to 2025, he trumpeted a crackdown on irregular migration and drug trafficking.

He has also flirted with far-right rhetoric, making at times contentious comments, including once at a rally declaring “down with the veil” in reference to headscarves worn by Muslim women.

“I will be the president of law and order, of justice, and of French pride,” Mr Retailleau said Feb 12.

He vowed to use referendums as mechanisms to enact new legislation.

He would start with a vote “to drastically reduce immigration” because “beyond a certain number, a multicultural society always becomes a multi-conflict society”, he said.

Other referendums would include reforming the criminal justice system and would “restore the primacy of our national law whenever it is a matter of protecting our fundamental interests”, he said.

However, the French Constitution bars the use of referendums on matters related to immigration or justice.

The LR leader said he also intends to “rebuild our social model” while reducing government spending “by giving priority to the France of honest people and to work rather than to welfare dependency”.

He vowed to implement “bold family policy” and education reform to tackle inequality.

Text: Real Madrid is counting on a team-bonding dinner reportedly paid for by the team’s biggest stars will boost their late-season pursuit of the La Liga and Champions League trophies.

Vinícius Júnior and Kylian Mbappé paid the bill at the restaurant in Madrid on Tuesday, midfielder Dani Ceballos told reporters. The tab ran over 1,000 euros ($1,100), according to accounts by Spanish media.

Vinícius posted a photo of the entire squad during the dinner near the city center in a fancy location that features “Art Dining Club.”

Fans waited outside the restaurant to try to talk to the players after the dinner, which went well past midnight.

Coach Álvaro Arbeloa and his assistants were not part of the dinner, Spanish media said.

The show of unity came a week before Madrid faces Benfica in the first leg of the knockout stage of the Champions League. The team dropped out of the top eight that automatically qualified for the round of 16 after a 4-2 loss at the same Benfica in the final round of the league phase.

Defender Raúl Asencio told media after the dinner that the team was “very united.”

Madrid went through turmoil at the end of last year, with some players reportedly not on the same page with coach Xabi Alonso, who was replaced by Arbeloa last month.

Madrid improved, but under Arbeloa it was eliminated by second-tier Albacete in the Copa del Rey round of 16, and lost to Benfica in the match that relegated the team to the Champions League’s first knockout stage.

In La Liga, Madrid has won seven in a row to be one point behind leader Barcelona. A victory against Real Sociedad on Saturday would lift Madrid into first place before Barcelona’s trip to face Girona on Monday.

Eighth-placed Sociedad is coming off a 1-0 win at Basque Country rival Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals.

Barcelona will look to win its fourth in a row in the league against a Girona that was in 12th place and was winless in its last three matches.

Barcelona visits Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey on Thursday, when it will arrive having won 17 of its last 18 matches in all competitions. The last setback was 2-1 at Sociedad in the league last month.

Third-placed Atletico is set to visit lowly Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, while fourth-placed Villarreal is at mid-table Getafe.

Mbappé trained separately from the squad on Thursday because of a knee issue and became doubtful for Saturday’s game at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. He had already been held to gym work on Wednesday. The club did not immediately give any detail about his condition.

Vinícius was set to be back with Madrid after missing the previous league game because of a yellow card suspension, but Jude Bellingham will remain sidelined with a hamstring injury.

It remained unclear if forward Raphinha would fully recover in time from a muscle issue to play for Barcelona against Girona. Barcelona forward Marcus Rashford was doubtful because of a knock to his knee.

Mbappé’s presence would be a huge boost for Madrid as the France star has nine goals in his last nine matches. He has 23 goals in 22 league games.

The Rayo game against Atletico could end up being postponed because of bad field conditions at Vallecas Stadium.

The field was replaced last week but it wasn’t in proper condition for last weekend’s game against Oviedo, which had to be postponed on short notice.

It has continued to rain a lot in Madrid this week, making it harder for the new grass to settle properly.

Text: 
The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by Tarique Rahman, secured an emphatic victory in the Bangladesh elections, with a resounding mandate in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the South Asian nation. Leading in over 200 seats in the 300-seat parliament, the party will now form the government with a two-thirds majority, while Jamaat-e-Islami will emerge as the main Opposition party in Bangladesh. This is a remarkable turnaround for a party that had long been a political pariah. These are the first national elections since the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Follow here for the latest updates on the Bangladesh Election Results 2026.


🚨 Big Story

Soon after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey submitted a notice moving a substantive motion against the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, the latter once again targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over India-US the trade deal, asserting, “do whatever you want, I am standing with the farmers” and “will not budge even an inch”. Gandhi’s remarks came a day after he mounted a sharp attack on the government, accusing it of compromising India’s energy security and farm interests in the trade deal. On Thursday, Dubey sought Gandhi’s “immediate expulsion” from the Lower House after initiating an “inquiry to examine all his unethical conduct”.

Then, is the LoP at the risk of being expelled? With the substantive motion moved against Gandhi, all eyes are on what this crucial instrument means. According to M N Kaul’s and S L Shakdher’s authoritative book Practice and Procedure of Parliament, “a substantive motion is a self-contained independent proposal submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a manner as to be capable of expressing a decision of the House.” They are put to a vote so that they express the decision of the House. Here’s what substantive motions mean.

Fallout: Following Union Petroleum Minister Hardeep Puri’s statement that he had met convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “three or four times”, Congress MP and party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Thursday demanded the resignation of the Cabinet Minister. Priyanka alleged that Puri had corresponded with Epstein after the allegations against him were made public. The fresh tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) on January 30 shows that Puri exchanged emails with Epstein in 2014-15. Referring to the documents, Priyanka told The Indian Express, “In my opinion, he should resign.”

“While we are opponents, we are not enemies”.

As the Parliament Budget Session 2026 is underway, our columnist Neerja Chowdhury reflects on the declining parliamentary standards in the country, which has now become “commonplace,” and suggests all MPs should remember BJP leader Sushma Swaraj’s words in 2014, during the last sitting of the 15th Lok Sabha.

In the backdrop of the recent disruptions in the Parliament that have rendered sessions dysfunctional, Chowdhury writes: “The bitterness that has come to vitiate the relationship between the two sides makes dialogue that much more difficult. While the government has to ensure Parliament runs smoothly, it is not possible without the cooperation of the Opposition, or without civility in public discourse, which is becoming a casualty.” Here’s why MPs need to recall Swaraj’s words once again.

📰 From the Front Page

Following a dip in membership and revenue, the legal fraternity, comprising 15 Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court, has now stepped in to save ‘Mohammad’ Deepak’s gym in Kotdwar. Deepak was thrust into the limelight in January when he stood up to a group of men who were harassing a 70-year-old Muslim shopkeeper, suffering from Parkinson’s disease, to drop the word “Baba” from his shop’s name. A video of Deepak calling himself Mohammad Deepak during the confrontation went viral, and he soon began to struggle to sustain his livelihood. The Senior Advocates have pitched in Rs 10,000 each as a one-year membership fee. The move, they said, was inspired by the act of CPI(M) MP John Brittas, who had visited the gym and purchased the membership.

The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) Thursday cleared the long-awaited proposal to buy 114 Rafale fighter jets from France under an inter-governmental deal for the Indian Air Force (IAF), of which 90 jets would be manufactured in India. Led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the DAC has also cleared the procurement of six additional P8I maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft from the US for the Navy. The development comes days before French President Emmanuel Macron’s scheduled visit to India between February 17 and 19.

📌 Must Read

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri Thursday held a meeting with United States Ambassador Sergio Gor in New Delhi, following which the latter confirmed that with the finalisation of the trade deal, many opportunities are poised to open up for partnership between the two countries. This comes on a day when New Delhi has categorically said that the joint statement released by both sides on February 7 remains the basis for the interim trade agreement.

In our Opinion section today, N K Singh takes a deep dive into India’s next steps as the world adjusts to the United States power politics. Singh writes: “A successful negotiation is often said to leave all sides equally dissatisfied. If this agreement raises exports and deepens technical-industrial capability during a disorderly global transition, it is a substantial achievement. It is ironic that a momentous mindset shift is met with prevarication. India is mature enough to seek purposeful engagement with a credible place in the global value added chain. What could have been a moment missed has become a moment seized.”

AI Stack: The success of artificial intelligence (AI) in India largely depends on how our AI applications can help improve the quality of life of our citizens. The Economic Survey 2026 is pragmatic about how India can leverage AI and solve its social and economic problems. Applications in health, agriculture, education, urban management, and disaster preparedness seem to show some promise. Certainly, with the right support, many of these can scale to a pan-India market and, later, can be bundled into an India AI Applications Stack. Take a look at some groundbreaking initiatives.

⏳ And Finally…

The whole of Pakistan is counting on Sahibzada Farhan against India, as both countries gear up to fight it out on Sunday at the Sri Lanka ground. For, Farhan has done what few other batsmen in the world have – to counterpunch Jasprit Bumrah and unsettle him in the first spell. My colleague Venkata Krishna B, who’s in Sri Lanka covering the ICC T20 World Cup, writes: “From 2019 to 2024, Pakistan has witnessed their batsmen crumble against Bumrah. Be it Ahmedabad or New York, Bumrah has cracked open the game with his artistry similar to how Pakistan’s wondrous seamers had subjected Indian batsmen during their good old days. Hence, Farhan’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed.”

🎧 Lastly, don’t forget to tune in to today’s episode of our 3 Things podcast, where we discuss the chaos over an AI-generated video of Himanta that left BJP red-faced; BJD protests in Odisha; as well as India’s latest procurement of 114 Rafale jets, Poseidon 8I maritime surveillance along with anti-submarine warfare aircraft.

That’s all for today. Have a wonderful day!

Until next time,

Text: European Union leaders are gathering in Belgium as the bloc argues over how to stand up to pressure from the United States, China and Russia

BILZEN-HOESELT, Belgium -- Leaders from across the European Union are meeting Thursday in a Belgian castle as the 27-nation bloc faces antagonism from U.S. President Donald Trump, strong-arm economic tactics from China and hybrid threats from Russia — challenges that have prompted a rethink of Europe's approach to diplomacy and trade.

“We all know we must change course, and we all know the direction,” said Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever on Wednesday ahead of the meeting. “Yet it sometimes feels like we’re standing on the bridge of the ship staring at the horizon without being able to touch the helm.”

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived together, crossing a drawbridge side by side into the 16th-century Alden Biesen castle, an image of unity between the two traditional power centers of the EU after each had publicly staked out different strategic positions.

“We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action,” Macron said while standing on a blue welcome carpet next to his German counterpart.

The session is meant to shape another summit in late March.

“We want to make this European Union faster, we want to make it better, and above all we want to ensure that we have competitive industry in Europe," Merz said.

Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni lead a wing of the bloc calling for deregulation, rebooting Europe's relationship with Washington and forging trade deals like the recent one struck with the Mercosur nations of South America.

France instead has led a push for “strategic autonomy ” — meaning a bloc less dependent on Washington.

Macron argues that EU countries should buy exclusively from European producers as the continent pursues greater military spending as a response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Merz and Meloni say purchases should be from both foreign and European firms.

In comments to reporters as he arrived at the moment, Macron said he was urging his partners to protect “sectors that are particularly under threat” like cleantech, chemicals, steel, the car industry and defense.

“There is also an increased pressure on us, with competition — sometimes unfair competition — that is very intense, with very strong pressure from China, tariffs imposed on us by the Americans with threats of coercive practices," Macron said.

EU leaders will also debate new financial instruments to protect the bloc in a global trading system rocked by Trump's blitzkrieg of tariffs and China's restricting of critical mineral exports.

Macron is renewing his call for the EU to be able to borrow money, which he described as “Eurobonds for the future" that would provide an opportunity “to challenge the hegemony of the dollar.”

Most leaders are calling for action along the lines of the economic stimulus strategy called for by Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank. The 2024 plan includes cutting regulations, making infrastructure investments and establishing trade ties with more countries. Draghi will address leaders assembled in the castle.

“We have way too many barriers that prevent money and capital from moving from one country to another, way too many obstacles to simplification,” said Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament. “No more words, but more action.”

Germany and Italy are expected to call on leaders to act by cutting EU red tape, strengthening the single market and “ensuring an ambitious trade policy based on shared rules and a level playing field.”

That echoes the economic security focus of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who like Merz and Metsola is a leading figure in the European People's Party, which is the largest bloc in the European Parliament and claims 13 heads of EU states as members.

“Our power on the global stage depends greatly on our strength on the economic front,” she said in a speech Wednesday.

Citizens across the bloc are hungry for a stronger EU and a more unified, stronger and ambitious leadership amid military threats, economic pressures and climate instability, according to an official EU poll, Eurobarometer.

“There has never been a better time for European leaders, national political leaders, to actually leverage on these European citizens’ demand for greater European action,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC Paris business school.

Text: Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz greeted the press together on arrival at the Alden Biesen Castle, with Macron saying they shared a "sense of urgency" on economic reform. But the two may clash on the way forward.

Heads of state and government from the EU gathered at an "informal retreat" at the Alden Biesen Castle in eastern Belgium on Thursday, in lieu of a full monthly leaders' summit in Brussels.

The talks will focus on reviving and streamlining Europe's economy, with the leaders also set to discuss ways to counter threats from China, Russia and the US.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sought to emphasize their areas of agreement while talking to reporters on arrival. This follows extensive media coverage on differences between the heads of the EU's two biggest economies as the bloc tries to remain competitive on the world stage.

"We want to speed up the European Union, we want to make it better, and we want to ensure that we have a competitive industry in Europe," Merz said standing by Macron's side.

"I believe we share this sense of urgency, that our Europe must take very clear action," Macron said.


The French and German leaders have so far outlined rather different visions of how to best achieve a more competitive business landscape within the EU.

Merz has been calling for the removal of red tape and regulations, reduced reporting requirements for businesses, reduced trade barriers between EU countries and for more international free trade agreements.

Macron, on the other hand, has called for issuing more pooled joint debt underwritten by the bloc as a whole, an idea Germany opposes.

"We have taken on European debt in exceptional situations — but those were exceptional situations," Merz said after the talks.

France has also vocally opposed the recently-agreed free trade deal between the EU and four Latin American countries, following widespread protests from French farmers. In turn, Merz criticized the last-minute delay to the deal's implementation in the European Parliament.

Macron hinted that Germany and France were moving closer together on one issue — harmonizing capital markets across the EU — in comments to reporters on Thursday. The European Commission recently proposed streamlining national rules to create a so-called savings and investment union, an old idea that run into obstacles in the past.

Belgian ‌Prime Minister ​Bart De Wever, who is hosting the summit, called for a focus on affordable power for industry at the meeting.

"The main issue for European industry right now is energy costs," Belgian ‌Prime Minister ​Bart De Wever said.

The power prices for European industry are more than double those in the US and China.

"We are not competitive and we risk losing the petrochemical industry, the steel industry, metals, and of course, this is the base of all prosperity," De Wever said.

Other leaders voiced frustration at the pace of change.

"There's so much talk and so little action, and this is a chance to reverse that trend," Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.

Czech Prime Minsiter Andrej Babis also lamented: "Only words, conferences, no action."

However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen struck a more optimistic note.

"The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains," she said.

On the eve of the retreat near Rijkhoven, leading European industry representatives called on EU leaders to take on the bloc's economic challenges with a greater urgency.

"We urge you to move from diagnosis to delivery, and from plans to results, with a single objective: Save our industry. Not next year, not next week, but today," a joint industry statement read.

Macron said that the EU should look to meet a June deadline of either reaching a consensus among its 27 member states, or possibly of forging ahead in a smaller group if necessary.

"We need to act fast and we need concrete decisions by June," the French president said. "If, in certain areas, we are not advancing as 27, we have the right to opt for reinforced cooperation [among fewer EU members] to go faster."

Text: European allies at NATO are putting on a brave face as the United States steps back from its leadership role at the alliance

BRUSSELS -- European allies at NATO on Thursday brushed aside concerns that the United States has stepped back from its leadership role of the world’s biggest security organization, leaving them and Canada to do the lion's share of defending Europe.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not attend Thursday’s gathering of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels. His no-show came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped the last meeting of NATO foreign ministers in December.

It’s rare for members of a U.S. administration to miss a meeting of the organization’s top decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, at the level of ministers, let alone two meetings in a row. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby was sent in Hegseth’s place.

“Sadly for him, he is missing a good party,” Icelandic Foreign Minister Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir told reporters. “Of course, it’s always better that the ministers attend here, but I would not describe it as a bad signal.”

“I’m not disappointed,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. “Each of us has a full agenda. And one time the American defense minister is here, and one time not, so it's his decision and his duties he has to fulfill.”

When asked what NATO’s purpose was in its infancy in 1949, NATO’s first secretary-general, the British general and diplomat Lord Hastings Ismay, was reputed to have replied: “To keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down.”

Nowadays, Germany is stepping up. After Russia invaded Ukraine four years ago, it vowed to spend 100 billion euros ($118 billion) to modernize its armed forces in coming years.

A big part of NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte’s job is to keep the Americans in.

“They have to take care of the whole world. This is the United States,” Rutte told reporters before chairing the meeting. “I totally accept it, agree with it.”

“They have always consistently pleaded for Europe doing more, Canada doing more, taking more care of the defense of NATO territory, of course in conjunction with the United States,” he said.

That means more European spending on conventional weapons and defense, while the U.S. guarantees NATO's nuclear deterrent.

But doubts linger, and surprises from the Trump administration cannot be ruled out. Allies still wonder whether more U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Europe.

“What for me is the most important is the no-surprise policy that has been agreed between the NATO secretary-general and the U.S.,” Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said.

Publicly at least, the Trump administration is doing much less at NATO. A year ago, Hegseth warned that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe would have to look after itself, and Ukraine in its battle against Russia's full-scale invasion.

Supplies of U.S. guns and money that were sent to Ukraine by the previous administration of President Joe Biden have dried up under Trump. European allies and Canada are obliged to buy weapons from the United States to donate now.

Western backers of Ukraine were also meeting at NATO on Thursday to drum up more military support. A scheme proudly championed by the Pentagon under Biden, the Ukraine Defense Contact Group is now chaired by the U.K. and Germany.

U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey announced that Britain would provide “an extra half a billion pounds ($682 million) in urgent air defense to Ukraine. This is Britain being a force for good in the world, building a new deal for European security within NATO.”

Sweden also intends to fund the purchase of more American weapons. The Netherlands will send more flight simulators to help Ukrainian fighter pilots train to fly F-16 jets.

The one “deliverable” from Thursday’s meeting was the announcement that NATO would launch Arctic Sentry, its response to U.S. security concerns in the high north, and an attempt to dissuade Trump from trying to seize Greenland.

It’s ostensibly aimed at countering Russian and Chinese activities or influence in the Arctic region.

But Arctic Sentry is essentially a rebranding exercise. National drills already underway in the region, like those run by Denmark and Norway, will be brought under the NATO umbrella and overseen by the organization’s military chief.

It is not a long-term NATO operation or mission.

Denmark, France, Germany will take part in the “military activities” happening under Arctic Sentry, but they have not said in what way. Finland and Sweden are likely to get involved. Belgium is considering what role it might play.

It remains unclear what role, if any, the United States will take.

“It can’t just be more from the United States,” U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said ahead of Thursday’s meeting. “We need capable allies that are ready and strong, that can bring assets to all of these areas of our collective security.”

Trump’s renewed threats last month to annex Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark — have deeply shaken the rest of the alliance. NATO’s primary role is to defend the territory of its 32 member states, not to undermine it.

European allies and Canada hope that Arctic Sentry and ongoing talks between the Trump administration, Denmark and Greenland will allow NATO to move on from the dispute and focus on Europe’s real security priority, Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said the Arctic security arrangement at least means that “we stop having some food fights over the Atlantic.”

“I think that the Greenland saga was not the best moment of NATO (over) the last 76 years," he told reporters. "It was a crisis that was not needed.”

Donald Trump’s sustained pressure for fairer burden-sharing has opened a real door, writes the US columnist

Thank goodness for Donald Trump, who seems more focused on Britain’s interests than its own Prime Minister, whose crisis of confidence is now on display to the entire world.

NATO allies, responding to sustained pressure from Trump for fairer burden-sharing, have agreed to place Britain in operational leadership of Joint Force Command Norfolk, a joint operational level command part of Nato — a clear elevation of UK sovereignty and defence authority — precisely as Keir Starmer’s government continues to destroy Britain’s independent strength through renewed deference to Brussels, risky economic overtures to Beijing, and persistent failure to secure the borders.

For years, European governments acted like children under permanent American protection, assuming the United States would underwrite their security forever.

It took a president willing to face elite outrage to state the obvious: Europe must shoulder its own defence burden. The need for such bluntness indicts Europe, not America.

America is Nato backbone — its funding, logistics, carrier groups, nuclear umbrella, and cultural confidence keep the alliance alive.

Strip that away, and Nato is a committee with a flag. Those offended by the directness should face the arithmetic: without America, Europe stands exposed. That truth deserves respect and gratitude from a continent liberated at enormous Allied cost.

For Britain, Trump’s sustained pressure for fairer burden-sharing has opened a real door. Nato's intensified focus on Atlantic sea lanes, Arctic deterrence, and undersea infrastructure protection matches Britain’s geography and strengths perfectly.

Joint Force Command Norfolk — safeguarding the Atlantic lifeline — now falls under British operational leadership as part of Nato's collective elevation of European roles.

Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed doubling troops in Norway from 1,000 to 2,000 over three years, with UK forces central to the new Arctic Sentry mission and leading joint exercises against Russian hybrid threats. This is not a ceremony. It is post-Brexit statecraft—Britain stepping up where it can exert genuine influence.

Now look at the policy reality under Starmer.


Starmer promised seriousness. What has emerged is managerial calamity when strategic clarity is required. Defence rhetoric has stiffened, but the fiscal commitment for rearmament lags badly.

New spending seems easier to justify for social transfers than for ships, munitions, and readiness.

A nation claiming Atlantic leadership cannot credibly do so while its Armed Forces stretch thinning resources across growing demands.

Downing Street’s January Beijing visit yielded £2.2billion in export deals, £2.3billion in market access over five years, and hundreds of millions in investments — including £250million potential from whisky tariff cuts. Trade serves statecraft; it is not statecraft itself.

Energy policy worsens the bind. The Ofgem cap sits at £1,758 for a typical household — still 45 per cent above pre-Ukraine levels and 69 per cent higher than winter 2020/21. Industrial costs erode competitiveness.

Net-zero targets remain untouchable despite questions over grid reliability, baseload power, and affordability. Energy security underpins national security. Pricing the industry into fragility cripples the capacity to fund defence and deterrence.

Borders tell the same story. The Government vowed to “smash the gangs”. Small-boat crossings hit over 41,000 in 2025—the second-highest annual total ever, up 13 per cent from 2024 — with high numbers continuing into early 2026. Adjustments have not delivered the decisive drop that would signal control restored.

This is no accident. It stems from a governing instinct: alignment with Brussels on regulation, global climate frameworks on virtue, and multilateral processes on migration. Presented as pragmatism, it erodes leverage. The rhetoric is moderate. The result is drift.

Across the Channel, the pattern repeats. Decades of underspending on defence while leaning on American power. The two per cent target is treated as optional.

Strategic autonomy is proclaimed far more than funded. Only Washington’s “extreme rhetoric” prompted modest increases. That is not a European triumph. It is prolonged complacency.

Memory matters too. Allied soldiers — American, British, Canadian—died by the thousands while liberating Europe. Britain repaid its Second World War loans only in 2004.

Respect should be shown in a serious defence effort. Instead, many settled into dependency. Freeloading is rude. It is also accurate.

France talks European leadership, but gains no comparable command in this realignment. Germany announces turning points and struggles to deliver. Britain — outside the EU, tied to the Special Relationship — holds a unique position: nuclear deterrent, global maritime reach, Five Eyes integration, Atlantic tradition. Geography and history favour it.

Opportunity does not ensure success.

A government fixated on Brussels resets, Beijing commercial deals, and palatable energy stories will squander an opening built on deterrence and resilience. Sovereignty is not words.

It is brigades, stockpiles, secure borders, and reliable power. It rests on cultural confidence: the assumption that national interest is legitimate and defence an obligation.

The world has hardened. Russian hybrids hit the High North infrastructure. Chinese strategies target ports and chains. American patience for free-riding has limits. Facts, not speculation.

Britain faces a choice. Persist in managerial disaster — neutralising borders, rationalising costly energy, constraining defence, balancing foreign policy carefully — and watch as its global integrity combusts.

Or treat American burden-sharing demands as a correction, not an insult. Restore energy realism, match defence funding to rhetoric, enforce borders decisively, and handle China with sobriety. Act as a sovereign state in a dangerous decade.

History rarely rewards mistaking comfort for strength. Britain still holds serious power instruments, but under Starmer’s leadership, they are receding every day.

This was reported on the official website of the Norwegian government, Ukrinform says.

The agreement enables Norway and France to cooperate in providing unique and in-demand defense materiel through purchases from French industry or donations from French stockpiles. As a first step, Norway is contributing approximately 4.2 billion Norwegian kroner (about $440 million), while France is guaranteeing a loan of around 3 billion kroner (about $300 million).

“Ukraine is now in the fourth winter following the invasion. The nation faces enormous military, civilian, and humanitarian needs as a consequence of Russian attacks. The new agreement between Norway and France permits us to cooperate on delivery of capabilities that Ukraine needs,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

The agreement includes the procurement of a large quantity of air-to-ground weapons from the French defense industry, as well as the expansion of Ukraine’s surveillance and situational awareness capabilities.

According to Norwegian Defense Minister Tore O. Sandvik, “the projects in this agreement meet crucial Ukraine priorities and have been identified following close dialogue with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.”

“The air-to-ground weapons are flexible glide bombs launched form combat aircraft that Ukraine currently operates. Ukraine already has positive experience with these weapons. Now we are making sure Ukraine gets the weapons they have asked for,” Sandvik concluded.

It is also noted that last year Norway and France signed an agreement to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries.

As previously reported by Ukrinform, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Norway contributed €420 million to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine under the PURL initiative.

Text: A cyclone packing violent winds has killed at least 35 people and caused devastation in Madagascar's second-largest city, the Indian Ocean island's disaster authority said Thursday, releasing an updated toll.

Cyclone Gezani made landfall on Tuesday, slamming into the eastern coastal city of Toamasina, with winds reaching 250 kilometres (155 miles) per hour.

The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNRGC) on Thursday said it had recorded 35 deaths, while six people remained missing and at least 374 were injured.

More than 8,800 people were displaced, it said.

Madagascar's new leader, Colonel Michael Randrianirina, on Thursday called for "international solidarity" after the cyclone "ravaged up to 75 percent of Toamasina and it surrounds".

AFP images from Wednesday showed the battered city of 400,000 people littered with hundreds of trees felled by strong winds, roofs blown off buildings, and residents wading through flooded streets.

Humanitarian staff worked into the night to clear roads blocked by debris, according to images shared with AFP on Thursday.

More than 18,000 homes were destroyed in the cyclone, according to the BNRGC, with 50,000 damaged or flooded.

The storm also caused carnage in the Atsinanana region surrounding the city, the authority said, adding that post-disaster assessments were still underway.

The CMRS cyclone forecaster on France's Reunion island confirmed Tuesday that Toamasina had been "directly hit by the most intense part" of the storm.

The cyclone's landfall was likely one of the most intense recorded in the region during the satellite era, rivalling Geralda in February 1994, it said. That storm left at least 200 dead and affected half a million more.

Gezani weakened after landfall but continued to sweep across the island as a tropical storm until Wednesday night.

It is forecast to return to cyclone status as it reaches the Mozambique Channel, according to the CMRS, and could from Friday evening strike southern Mozambique, which has already faced devastating flooding since the beginning of the year.

Cyclone season in the southwest Indian Ocean typically lasts from November to April and sees around a dozen storms each year.

Alessandro Haemmerle of Austria and Canada’s Eliot Grondin repeated as gold and silver medalists in men’s snowboardcross at the Winter Olympics on Thursday after another close finish between the two rivals.

Grondin looked to be in position to flip the result from Beijing 2022 coming over the final roll, but Haemmerle closed the small gap over the final meters and thrust his board ahead of Grondin’s to successfully defend his title.

Haemmerle's winning margin four years ago: 0.02 seconds.

On Thursday? Just 0.03.

Fellow Austrian Jakob Dusek took bronze, keeping France’s Aidan Chollet off the podium, when all four riders had a shot at victory approaching the finish.

2022 Olympic mixed snowboardcross champion American Nick Baumgartner, 44, reached the semifinals before being eliminated.

In snowboardcross, four riders race on a course with banks and rolling bumps to see who finishes first. The first two racers advance from each round in bracket fashion to the final.

Grondin won the 2024/25 Crystal Globe and the 2025 world champion, when Haemmerle took bronze.

On Sunday, Austrian snowboarder Benjamin Karl defended his gold in men’s parallel giant slalom.

Text: MOSCOW, February 12. /TASS/. The expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) does not automatically trigger a chain reaction that will provoke a global arms race, Daryl Kimball, Executive Director of the American Arms Control Association, said in an interview with the TASS Analytical Center.

"An arms race 2.0 is not inevitable. [However] without the New START limits or a bilateral understanding to continue to respect those limits, a buildup of US and Russian deployed strategic nuclear weapons is very possible, and if that begins, then yes, we are looking at a period of three-way arms racing (involving the United States, Russia, and China). Whether this happens or not will depend on what the leaders of these three countries do or do not do in the coming months," the expert said.

Kimball acknowledged that, despite the positive results of the Anchorage summit, real negotiations on strategic stability have not yet been conducted between the administration of US President Donald Trump and the current Russian authorities. "My sources indicate there have been no real talks since the Alaska summit and there is still no US proposal (nor any Russian proposal) to do so despite Trump’s stated desire for a "better deal" that also somehow involves China," the expert noted. According to Kimball, "Nor has the Team Trump outlined to the Chinese or anyone else how the US proposes to achieve this [deal], neither in terms of the format of the substance," which, in his view, "indicates an utter failure of leadership."

The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the last international legal limitation on nuclear weapons deployment, expired on February 5. Trump stated that he hoped to conclude a better agreement that would include China as well.

Russia proposed to continue to observe the New START restrictions for another year after the New START expiration, but has not received any official response from Washington to this initiative. Regarding China’s participation, Moscow believes that this is a matter for Beijing itself and will respect any decision by the Chinese side. At the same time, Russia emphasized that if the START's scope were to be expanded, it would be to include the US's nuclear NATO allies – Britain and France – whose nuclear potential is not covered by any strategic stability treaty.

Text: 
India approved the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France on Thursday, marking one of its largest aircraft orders, ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the country.

The approval was part of New Delhi's 3.6 trillion rupee ($39.7 billion) defence spending package covering multiple acquisitions across the armed forces.

The Defence Ministry did not specify how many aircraft would be ordered. Local media reported that India will purchase 114 Rafale jets, with 18 supplied by manufacturer Dassault and the remaining 96 manufactured domestically.

The broader package includes Boeing P8I Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft for its navy, anti-tank mines for its ground forces, and upgrades to its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles.

The new aircraft are expected to help address a shortfall in the Indian air force, which operates 29 squadrons against a minimum requirement of 42, according to a 2024 parliamentary report.

The air force most recently retired two squadrons of Cold War-era MiG-21 fighters in September 2025, and is expected to phase out additional aircraft in the coming years.

The Rafale purchase follows another order in April for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for India's Navy. Dassault said India would become the first user outside France to operate this variant.

Rafale jets were used by the Indian Air Force during its 2025 conflict with Pakistan, when at least one aircraft was reported lost in combat against Islamabad's Chinese-made J-10Cs.

Macron, who will be in India from Feb. 17 to 19, is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across sectors.The two leaders will also launch the India-France Year of Innovation and attend the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, according to India's external affairs ministry."The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest, including cooperation in the Indo-Pacific," the release added.

Text: PARIS, February 13. /TASS/. French President Emmanuel Macron said that a possible conversation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin is not planned in the coming days, according to remarks he made after an informal EU summit in Belgium.

"This is not a matter for the coming days," Macron said.

He added that his diplomatic adviser had already visited Russia. "We are preparing the ground," the French leader said, according to a video of his speech posted on the Elysee Palace’s X page.

Asked whether he intended to invite Russian representatives to any G7 meetings in France, Macron said that "this is not on the agenda" unless the conflict in Ukraine ends. "But I don’t feel that this will happen soon," the president said.

Earlier, Macron said in an interview with the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung that he had suggested in a conversation with several European colleagues that the dialogue with Russia be resumed. In his view, the current framework for talks on Ukraine, in which US representatives discuss settlement terms with Moscow without European participation, "is not optimal."

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on February 12 that Macron’s stated desire to hold a phone conversation with Putin had never gone beyond words.
