Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, has declared that his country will never be a “vassal” of the United States while he is in charge. He suggested that opposition-aligned President Karol Nawrocki, an ally of Donald Trump, favours Poland having such a subservient role to Washington.

Tusk’s comments come amid a period of tension over Polish-American relations, including a dispute between the government and president over joining Trump’s Board of Peace and the US ambassador’s decision to cut relations with the speaker of Poland’s parliament after he “outrageously insulted” Trump.

💬 Premier @donaldtusk przed wylotem do #Belgia:Polska była, jest i będzie pewnym sojusznikiem Stanów Zjednoczonych. Jednak tak długo, jak ja będę premierem, Polska nie będzie w tej relacji wasalem.

— Kancelaria Premiera (@PremierRP) February 12, 2026

Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning ahead of a visit to Belgium for a summit of EU leaders, Tusk insisted that “Poland has been, is, and will remain a reliable ally of the United States”.

“However, as long as I am prime minister, Poland will not be a vassal in this relationship,” he continued. “Allied relations cannot consist of someone constantly saying yes to everything.”

Tusk said he had “told the president this unequivocally” on Wednesday at a meeting of the National Security Council called by Nawrocki. But “I have the impression that he has a different opinion on this matter”, added Tusk.

While Tusk and his government emphasise that the US remains a vital ally for Poland, he and some of his ministers have also been critical of Trump and his administration. Tusk himself recently co-signed a statement with other European leaders calling on the US to respect Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland.

Nawrocki and the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party with which he is aligned have accused the government of harming relations with Washington through its rhetoric and actions.

The president, for example, has expressed support for Poland joining Trump’s Board of Peace, whereas Tusk on Wednesday confirmed that the government would not do so “under current circumstances”.

Poland will not join President Trump's Board of Peace "under current circumstances", says Prime Minister @donaldtusk.

The government has "doubts over the form of the board" but does not rule out joining in future "if there is a change in circumstances" https://t.co/P8zCwQJjo9

— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) February 11, 2026

Nawrocki has also raised concerns about the government applying for €44 billion (185 billion zloty) in loans from the European Union to cover defence spending.

The majority of the money must be spent within Europe, which the presidential palace says could harm relations with the US, where Poland has, until now, purchased much of its military hardware.

Speaking today, Tusk said that he “does not quite understand the president’s concerns” over the loans and hopes they are “not a prelude to a veto”. The government yesterday approved a bill relating to the funds, which would require Nawrocki’s approval once it passes through parliament.




“Nearly 200 billion zloty will go to Poland on very favourable terms, otherwise unavailable on the financial market,” added Tusk. “According to the estimates of generals involved in the project, over 80% of the funds will go to companies operating in Poland.”

“Thanks to this money, we will build things vital to our security, such as the East Shield [fortifications on the Belarusian and Russian borders] and the anti-drone shield,” he added.

Tensions also flared last week when the US ambassador to Poland, Thomas Rose, announced the cutting of relations with Włodzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Tusk’s ruling coalition.

Tusk immediately came to Czarzasty’s defence, telling Rose that “allies should respect, not lecture each other”. PiS figures have criticised the prime minister and Czarzasty for harming relations with Washington.

The speaker of parliament has launched the process of selecting new members of a key judicial body, despite the fact that it will take place under rules introduced by the former government that the current authorities regard as illegitimate.

The institution in question, the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), is responsible for nominating judges to courts. It has been at the heart of Poland’s rule-of-law dispute after the former Law and Justice (PiS) government in 2017 changed the manner in which the KRS’s members are appointed.

Previously, most were chosen by judges themselves. However, after PiS’s reforms, most were selected by politicians. The move was widely condemned by expert bodies as undermining judicial independence. Polish and European court rulings have found the KRS to no longer be a legitimate body.

The government that replaced PiS in 2023 has proposed legislation to transfer the power to elect most KRS members back to the judiciary. The bill was approved by parliament in January but has yet to be signed by President Karol Nawrocki, a PiS ally.



— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) November 6, 2025

Given that the four-year terms of current KRS members will expire on 12 May, Wednesday this week was the final day permitted by law for parliament to launch the procedure for choosing their replacements, which must start at least 90 days in advance.

Justice minister Waldemar Żurek and Włodzimierz Czarzasty, the speaker of the Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament, had expressed hope that Nawrocki would sign the law before that deadline.

However, as he had not done so by Wednesday, Czarzasty said that he had no choice but to launch the process of choosing new KRS members because, although the current rules are flawed, they remain binding.

Marszałek Sejmu Włodzimierz Czarzasty wydał obwieszczenie o rozpoczęciu procedury zgłaszania kandydatów na członków Krajowej Rady Sądownictwa wybieranych spośród sędziów. https://t.co/Koz54BFHBL

— tvn24 (@tvn24) February 12, 2026

“I asked the president to…sign the bill on the KRS, which he has in his possession. He did not sign it. Therefore, the president takes full responsibility for the fact that I had to initiate the procedure according to the old, bad law,” said Czarzasty, quoted by the Onet news website.

He noted that the law currently in force “takes away judges’ independence” and “has led to the legal system being very unstable”. Because thousands of judicial appointments have been made by the reformed KRS since 2017, there are legal doubts about the status of those judges and the legitimacy of their rulings.

In one recent case, a court annulled a divorce because it had been granted by a judge appointed through the disputed process.

Earlier this week, however, Czarzasty said that, if the president ends up signing the bill, any steps taken under the current rules to elect new members would have no legal effect. Nawrocki has until 19 February to make a decision.

Żurek announced earlier this week that the government has a “plan B” if the president vetoes the bill, which he said officials at the presidencial palace had indicated was likely.

The plan would involve parliament, where the government has a majority, simply approving KRS members democratically chosen by judges themselves. That would in effect restore the situation that existed before PiS’s 2017 reform, though without actually changing the law.

“Let the democratic majority respect the choice of the judicial community, so that this process is in line with the constitution and serves citizens as well as the stability of judicial rulings,” said Żurek on social media.

Dziś rozpoczyna się procedura zgłaszania kandydatów do KRS.

Niech sędziowie wybiorą najlepszych spośród siebie – ludzi kompetentnych, niezależnych i o niekwestionowanym kręgosłupie moralnym.

Większość demokratyczna niech uszanuje wybór środowiska, tak aby proces ten był zgodny… pic.twitter.com/SeyMjrCqG1

— Waldemar Żurek (@w_zurek) February 11, 2026

In 2019, Poland’s Supreme Court ruled that, due to PiS’s reforms, “the KRS is not an impartial and independent body” as it had been rendered “dependent on the executive authorities”. In 2022, the same court found the KRS to no longer be consistent with its role outlined in the constitution.


However, even some proponents of reversing PiS’s reforms have argued that it would be impractical and unfair to simply cancel all appointments made through the KRS since 2017, leading the ruling coalition to put forward bills that included measures to resolve the status of illegitimately appointed judges.

A plushie in the form of a smiling pieróg – Poland’s famous stuffed dumpling – has become a huge hit at the ongoing Winter Olympics in Italy after being adopted as an unofficial mascot of the Polish figure-skating team.

The cooperative for people with disabilities that creates the toy says it has been overwhelmed with orders.

— CBC Olympics (@CBCOlympics) February 6, 2026

The mascot is called “Pieroguszka”, which combines the words pieróg (meaning dumpling, with the plural being pierogi) and poduszka, meaning pillow. It was purchased in Poland and then taken to Italy by a member of the national figure-skating team.

Soon after the team was photographed waving the mascot around, it became an online hit, doing the rounds on social media and prompting comments from journalists, fans and athletes.

It reportedly even attracted the attention of American rap superstar Snoop Dogg, who has been enthusiastically attending the Winter Olympics.

Ekaterina Kurakova, a member of the Polish figure-skating team, told Polish news outlet Interia that the rapper had tried to reach out to the team through intermediaries in the hope of getting himself a Pieroguszka.

The mascot is produced by the Katowice-based “Honolulu Social Cooperative” during handicraft workshops for people with disabilities. Social cooperatives are organisations that combine the functions of a business and an NGO, and are mostly made up of people who are at risk of social exclusion.

“We’ve been around for over 10 years,” the cooperative’s head, Przemysław Sołtysik, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). “Initially, we were a restaurant but, during the pandemic, we had to find something to do in the meantime. So we started sewing Pieroguszkas and opened a shop, which is still operating today.”

“We’re having trouble keeping up with orders,” he added. “We didn’t know this [plushie] was going to Milan, we only saw it in photos. Then the [Polish figure-skating] association contacted us and ordered more, which are now on their way to Milan.”

Pierogi are perhaps the most famous element of Polish cuisine. Eaten boiled or fried, the most common fillings include cheese and potatoes (pierogi ruskie), ground meat (pierogi z mięsem), and mushroom and cabbage (pierogi z kapustą i grzybami).

They can also be eaten in sweet form with fruit inside and served with sour cream and sugar. Savoury pierogi, meanwhile, are often accompanied with fried bacon and onions.

Last year, another Polish sports star helped introduce an element of Polish culinary culture to the world.

On her way to winning the Wimbledon Championships, tennis player Iga Świątek revealed that her favourite post-match meal is pasta with strawberries and yoghurt, prompting many fans to try the traditional Polish summer dish.

US defence giant Northrop Grumman and Polish arms manufacturer Niewiadów-PGM have announced plans to jointly produce over 180,000 155-mm artillery shells annually in Poland.

The endeavour aims to meet growing demand for ammunition in Europe, including potentially supplying Ukraine, while also catering to the US market.

— Niewiadów Polska Grupa Militarna (@grupaniewiadow) February 11, 2026

On Tuesday, Niewiadów announced the adoption of a framework agreement with Northrop Grumman, which follows a memorandum of understanding signed last year.

“Northrop Grumman brings its experience in the design and production of artillery ammunition and advanced manufacturing technologies, while companies belonging to the Niewiadów group contribute expertise in handloading, assembly, and final product integration,” said the Polish firm.

In comments to Reuters on Wednesday, Northrop Grumman’s managing director for Poland, Quinn Canole, said that “Poland was a natural location” to help internationalise Northrop Grumman’s technology.

He revealed that production of so-called “qualification rounds”, which are meant for testing purposes, would start “definitely inside this year”, with the aim of then ramping up output to reach a target of more than 180,000 155-mm artillery shells a year.

Mirosław Klepaczewski, head of Elaboracja Niewiadów, a subsidiary group, said on Tuesday that the new agreement demonstrates the partners’ ability to “effectively respond to the growing demand for artillery ammunition in Europe”.

However, Canole confirmed to Reuters that production would cater to the US market as well as Europe. She also did not rule out Ukraine as a potential client. Such shells are widely used by Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression, but have been in short supply.

Polish state defence group @PGZ_pl has formed a strategic partnership with Britain's @BAESystemsplc to produce 155mm artillery shells.

The deal will see BAE Systems transfer "technology and know-how" for Poland to produce the ammunition domestically https://t.co/nT77RCGZog

— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 12, 2025

In March last year, the head of then-President Andrzej Duda’s National Security Bureau caused concern when he warned that Poland only had enough ammunition to defend itself “for a week or two” if it were attacked by Russia. However, his claims were rejected as untrue by the government.

Nevertheless, Poland has been since been seeking to increase its domestic ammunition production capacity. In 2024, a special law was passed granting defence firms up to 3 billion zloty (€712 million) to invest in such production.

Last year, state defence group Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa (PGZ) similarly launched a partnership with Britain’s BAE Systems to produce 155-mm artillery shells.

Prime Minister Tusk said at the time that the deal was part of government plans to increase the production of large-calibre shells to 130,000 annually within two years.

Poland has increased the production of small-calibre ammunition fivefold – to one million bullets a day – at state-owned defence firm Mesko following the opening of a new production facility https://t.co/kcGh7EDT54

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has significantly increased its wider defence spending, including making large-scale purchases from the United States and South Korea of tanks, self-propelled howitzers and aircraft, among other hardware.

Poland is currently NATO’s largest relative defence spender, with its defence budget set to reach 4.8% of GDP this year. Spending began to rise under the former Law and Justice (PiS) government but has continued to expand under the current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Text: MOSCOW, February 12. /TASS/. Polish electricity transmission operator PSE said an underwater power line in the Baltic Sea, connecting Poland to Sweden, has been switched off due to a malfunction.

"The Poland-Sweden connection is temporarily offline due to a fault," the company said in a statement on its website.

PSE does not suspect a "deliberate act" to be behind the outage.

According to Europe’s power market NordPool, the incident occurred at around 10:00 p.m. Moscow time (7:00 p.m. GMT) on Wednesday. Power supplies are expected to be resumed on Friday night.

The 200-km SwePol Link undersea cable connects a power generation facility near Poland’s Slupsk with the power station near the town of Karlshamn in Sweden.
