Madison Chock and Evan Bates have responded to questions about judging in the recent Olympic ice dance pairs final. Chock called for judges to be vetted for the sake of transparency.

The couple was looking to defend their gold medal, but came in second to the French duo of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron.

A French judge graded Beaudry and Cizeron higher than Chock and Bates, which helped push the French team to gold over the Americans. The judging has been a topic of controversy on social media, with some arguing that Chock and Bates should have graded higher.

Chock told CBS News, "It would "definitely be helpful if it's more understandable for the viewers, to just see more transparent judging and understand ... what's really going on.

"I think it's also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed to make sure that they are also putting out their best performance," she continued. "Because there's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all, and we deserve to have the judges also giving us their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field."

Chock's answer came shortly after she sang a different tune when asked by NBC News about judging.

"We’ve certainly gone through a roller coaster of emotions, especially in the last 24 hours," Chock told NBC News. "And I think what we will take away is how we felt right after our skates and how proud we were of what we accomplished and how we handled ourselves throughout the whole week. Putting out four great performances at the Olympic Games is no small feat, and we’ve got a lot to be proud of."

Bates told USA Today, "We felt like we delivered our absolute best performance that we could have. It was our Olympic moment. It felt like a winning skate to us, and that's what we're going to hold on to."

Bates also praised the fans who are speaking out in support of the American couple during the controversy.

"It means a lot that people are voicing their opinions on our behalf," Bates said. "The way that we skated and the way that we've approached chasing these goals hopefully has resonated with people at home even in our response. I think, hopefully, that too can reflect the Olympic spirit."



They finished with 224.39 after notching a 134.67 score in their free dance.


But the judges decided the French duo did enough to defeat the Americans in the end.

Beaudry and Cizeron scored a 135.64 in the free dance for a total of 225.82.

Chock and Bates were looking to experience receiving their gold medals on the podium after a delayed reception of their medals at the 2022 games.

Chock and Bates initially had to settle for team silver with their American teammates on the podium at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Team Russia and Kamila Valieva, who was 15 at the time, stood above them with their gold medals.

It wasn't until the end of January 2024, when the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found Valieva guilty of an anti-doping rule violation, when Chock, Bates and the U.S. were declared the rightful 2022 gold medalists.

Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned substance, during an anti-doping test at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in December 2021. She was suspended for four years and stripped of all competitive results since that date.

Chock and Bates spoke about what their message to Valieva would be today during an interview at the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee media summit in October.

"It's hard to, I think, imagine what a 15-year-old has gone through and under that kind of situation," Bates said. "And I know how stressful it is, being an elite athlete as an adult, as a 36-year-old. And I think that grace should be given to humans across the board. And we can never really know the full situation, at least from our point of view. … I genuinely don't know what I would say to her."

Chock added, "I would just wish her well, like, as I would. I think life is short. And, at the end of the day, we're all human just going through our own human experience together. And regardless of what someone has or hasn't done and how it has affected you, I think it's important to remember we're humans as a collective, and we're all here for this, our one moment on earth, at the same time. And I just wish people to have healthy, happy lives, full of people that love them."

Chock and Bates had to wait more than two years after the initial Olympics to get their rightful gold medals, and they were finally presented with them during a ceremony at the Paris Olympics in summer 2024.

Title: Russia to ship oil to Cuba in defiance of Trump tariff threat

Text: Russia is preparing to ship oil to Cuba under the guise of “humanitarian aid” — brazenly defying President Trump’s warning that countries propping up the communist regime could be hit with punishing US tariffs.

The move signals a fresh geopolitical test from Vladimir Putin, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on hostile governments and works to choke off financial and energy lifelines to authoritarian regimes in the Western Hemisphere.

Moscow’s embassy in Havana told Russian media that the oil shipment is expected soon but refused to disclose volumes, as Cuba faces dangerously low fuel reserves that are designed to crank up the pressure on its regime.

Trump has recently warned foreign nations that supplying fuel to Cuba could trigger trade retaliation, part of a broader effort to hold the regime accountable for human rights abuses, economic repression, and its decades-long alignment with America’s adversaries.

That approach apparently has already worked on Mexico — the last country to deliver oil, on Jan. 9 — which has since frozen further shipments following Trump’s tariff threat. The US has also stopped Venezuela, once Cuba’s main oil benefactor, from exporting oil to Havana.

Cuba is now staring down one of its most severe fuel crises in years, with widespread blackouts, rationing, transportation breakdowns and mounting public unrest.

Analysts cited by Russian media warned the island could run out of fuel in roughly 20 days without new imports.





Russia last sent a major oil shipment to Cuba in February 2025, delivering about 100,000 tons of crude under a $60 million state-backed loan personally approved by Putin.

The shipment could escalate tensions between Washington and Moscow, while putting more Russian tankers at risk of sanctions, seizures or other enforcement actions as Trump intensifies pressure on adversarial powers.

Critics argue Russia’s “humanitarian” framing is little more than propaganda — a strategic play to keep a longtime Cold War–era ally alive while expanding Kremlin influence in America’s backyard.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has once again refused to directly deny claims by the United States government on Russian oil imports on Thursday (February 12, 2026). This comes after a senior U.S. official said that India had reduced its purchases of Russian crude, as the U.S. “wanted [India] to.”

The government expressed satisfaction at the amendments made by the U.S. administration to its “fact sheet” on the India-U.S. trade deal. The fact sheet, available on the White House website, has now dropped contentious references to pulses and agriculture, saying it reflects the “shared understanding” between India and the U.S. on trade. However, it continues to state that India has committed to stop buying Russian oil.

“The Joint Statement is the framework and remains the basis of our mutual understanding in the matter. Both sides will now work towards implementing this framework and finalising the Interim Agreement,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. “The amendments in the U.S. fact sheet reflect the shared understandings contained in the Joint Statement.” The joint statement does not contain any mention of Russian oil purchases.

As the Opposition continued to raise questions about the agreement in Parliament, U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor met with Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri on Thursday (February 12, 2026). So many opportunities ahead now that the trade deal has been finalized,” Mr. Gor wrote in a post on social media.

Mr. Jaiswal refused to comment further on the U.S.’s contentions about Russian oil, a thorny issue that has also been discussed in Parliament and was raised repeatedly by members of the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs who were briefed by Mr. Misri.

At other briefings, both Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Energy Minister Hardeep Puri have refused to answer questions on India’s response to the U.S. claims, directing them to the MEA. In a public statement, Mr. Misri said earlier this week that India’s energy sourcing is guided by pricing, availability, and risks, but did not respond to questions about the sharp month-on-month decline in India’s imports of Russian oil.

On Wednesday (February 11, 2026), at a hearing of the U.S. House Sub-Committee on Foreign Affairs on U.S. ties with South Asia, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State S. Paul Kapur repeated statements by U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer asserting that India’s actions had been part of the larger trade deal with the U.S.

“The Indians have been reducing their purchases of Russian oil and diversifying away [from it], which is what we [the U.S.] wanted them [India] to do,” Mr. Kapur told the committee. “They’ve actually been buying more U.S. energy and that’s, I think, a promising possibility is to substitute some U.S. energy for the Russian energy and buying from other parts of the world,” he added.

When asked about the repeated statements, Mr. Jaiswal said that Mr. Misri had responded to the “kind of commentary and conversations” being heard, including in the US.

“Exactly to clarify matters, our Foreign Secretary has made a detailed statement... highlighting the various aspects of where [India’s] approach to energy sourcing remains,” he said. However, he refused to answer a question from The Hindu on whether the government’s response to the persistent U.S. claims was a “yes or no”.

According to the White House fact sheet still available online, Mr. Trump had discussed the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their call on February 2, and had “agreed to remove the additional 25% tariff on imports from India in recognition of India’s commitment to stop purchasing Russian Federation oil.”

Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture, the Fisheries Agency said early Friday.

The incident in the waters off southwestern Japan marks the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat, coming at a time when diplomatic relations between Japan and China have remained strained for months under the leadership of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.

Zheng Nianli, the 47-year-old Chinese skipper of the fishing boat, was arrested Thursday and stands accused of trying to evade an onboard inspection by a Japanese fisheries control officer about 170 kilometers southwest of the island of Meshima in Goto, Nagasaki.

According to the agency's regional office, the vessel had a crew of 11 and is described as a "tiger net fishing boat," usually known for catching fish such as mackerel and horse mackerel.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told a regular press conference on Friday in Tokyo that while an investigation into the case continues, the Japanese government will act "resolutely" through enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal operations by foreign fishing vessels.

The Chinese fishing boat is also the first foreign fishing boat seized by the Japanese Fisheries Agency this year.

The agency conducts onboard inspections and other operations to combat illegal fishing in Japanese waters. Last year, it seized two foreign fishing vessels -- one Taiwanese and one South Korean.

According to its annual report, in 2024 the agency conducted seven onboard inspections, seized a Taiwanese fishing boat and confiscated illegal fishing gear in 18 cases.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

Fishing disputes are one place where Japan can lay down the law without too much blowback. But the ownership of Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is a much more volatile matter that must be handled carefully in order not to push the two countries into a stand-off that neither can back away from.

Cue Chinese outrage at this abominable attack on an innocent itinerant fisherman who is just trying to feed his family...

Hahahaha

In the September 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with a Japan Coast Guard patrol vessel off the coast of the Senkaku Islands (Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture), the Naha District Public Prosecutors Office's decision to release the arrested Chinese captain without further action was reportedly cited as "protecting the Senkaku Islands from China."

In a case where the administration was cozying up to China, then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan and others in the Prime Minister's Office reportedly conveyed their desire to "release" the captain. Former Foreign Minister and House of Representatives member Seiji Maehara also stated that the release was "an instruction from Prime Minister Kan."

It is unusual for prosecutors, who base their work on "law and evidence," to take political factors into consideration, but a prosecutor familiar with the situation at the time said, "The administration lacked the information, equipment, and resolve to protect the Senkaku Islands, and public opinion had not been sufficiently cultivated. Considering the national interest, they could not abandon important territory for the sake of judicial appearances."

Such an approach is unlikely to be taken under the Takaichi administration.

Chinese netizens would be asking for war with Japan now even harder, of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel.  what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

And as my user name says, "NO SUSHI FOR YOU!"

Those were the last words the illegal Chinese captain/fisherman heard from the Japanese Coast Guard after he was detained.

Skip a few episodes. China will leverage rare earths. There’s little Japan can do but that’s for when the wheels come off.

Recently, Japanese media announced with great fanfare the discovery of 16 million tons of rare earth minerals in waters near Minami-Torishima Island, approximately 2,000 kilometers from the mainland, claiming it ranks third globally in reserves.

This so-called "major discovery" was first reported by Japanese media back in 2012, with headlines even more sensational than today's. By 2018, Japan had recycled the same story once again, claiming the rare earths discovered could supply global demand for hundreds of years. Now in 2026, the news has resurfaced yet again, using virtually identical wording from eight years ago.

So no Japan has no rare earths it processes commercially and it would be foolish to replay 2012 with today’s China. Best to get along with your neighbors.

of course many are already claiming Kyushu in addition to Okinawa as part of their territory.

I think there’s some confusion here, so let me clarify a few points.

Okinawa was historically part of the Ryukyu Kingdom, known in  Chinese sources in the Ming as 小琉球國, while Taiwan was referred to as 大琉球國 during parts of the Ming period. The Ryukyu Kingdom had its own distinct political status and tributary relationships, and Taiwan’s status also changed over time, including its annexation by the Qing.

However, Okinawa has not historically been claimed as Chinese territory in the way you’re suggesting. an d neither had Kyushu.

Equating historical naming conventions or tributary ties with formal territorial claims is misleading.

If we’re going to discuss history, we should at least be accurate about the distinctions between tribute relationships, naming, and sovereignty. We should also be honest about claims made by net citizens.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

It was learned on February 6th that after Chinese authorities tightened export controls on dual-use items to Japan in January, they have now approved multiple exports of rare earths to Japan.

China appears to be wary of Japan, the US, and Europe accelerating their efforts to reduce their dependence on China for rare earth procurement.

China should not give in to trivial matters and should stick to its strong policy of banning exports to Japan.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The rule of law being enforced on the high seas. The Chinese fishing boat militia will hate it and go into another meltdown. Just keep watching the behavior guys. Zero need for politics whatsoever when it comes to this stuff.

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

spoke too soon about the politics. Our friend Agent Neo deciding to give us this lovely tidbit of timely ‘information’ when it comes to the concept of sea zones and Japans sovereign waters. Just throw it out there like a net and see what swims in.

So the narrative is this. Remember this is after an incident of a ‘fisherman’ being arrested due to IGNORING messages and warnings that he had entered Japans waters illegally.

Don’t like that? Just double down.

Go straight to deny Japans own waters, by suggesting matter of factly that Okinawa now may not be part of Japan after all. They have kindly rewritten history to suit their own agenda. Such a service, the education factor.

Then tying Japan to their nemesis the U.S and rare Earths too as another effort to justify their actions and behaviors, and hopefully net some sympathy with the self hating subsection of our countries. No need to even say which ones at this point either. I’m sure y’all can take a wild guess.

Agent Neo thanks for the insight, love the name too.

What is the Matrix?

The matrix is control.

Fair cop....Australia taking an aggressive stance in its northern sea borders

Unsure how we stop the super ships that vacuum the whole sea bed.....often sent by EU countries like Norway

and Guru. Just perfect mate. Marvelously you. Norway and Australia the aggressors. Gurus an Aussie btw folks. Go figure that one out.

Am home in Perth by the way fella! Paradise!

The Ryukyu Dynasty in Okinawa was not an independent ethnic group.

They were the Jomon people who branched off from mainland Japan, and they share the same ancestors.

The people in Taiwan are not an independent ethnic group. They are the Han people who crossed the Straights from mainland China, and they share the same ancestors.

Your conclusion is?

check the ship's bridge and study the equipment and search the compartments, I'm going to bet that this might be a ship under the maritime militia, a paramilitary force under the chinese navy. If not, it's still a good move to do so. But, I can imagine after Takaichi's landslide victory, the Cancel Culture Party's emotional fuse is running short as of late. This incident might just be what's needed to give them another hissy fit.

Good on you, Japan.

Is there any need to ask obvious questions about Taiwan?

It has long been inhabited by Austronesian indigenous people.

In the 16th century, the Portuguese called it "Formosa" (Beautiful Island).

If the indigenous people of Taiwan were of mainland Chinese descent, I wouldn't have any complaints.

But that's not the case.

It began as an island of indigenous people, then passed through the Dutch and Spanish colonial period in the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty, Japan's rule for about 50 years (1895-1945), and finally arrived at the present day Republic of China.

Since it was a colony of the Netherlands, Spain, and Japan, would the Chinese Communist Party recognize any country that claimed it?

Just because Okinawa paid tribute to China doesn't mean it's Chinese territory, of course. Japan also paid tribute to China until the Tang Dynasty.

And unlike Taiwan, Okinawa has never been Chinese territory.

The Senkaku Islands also became an issue after undersea resources were discovered in the 1970s.

Until then, the Chinese Communist Party also treated them as Japanese territory...

The Matrix is ​​"virtual reality." Thanks.

how does this culminate in an arrest and boarding the vessel. what happened to water cannons to persuade to turn the heck around?

Vessels of any nation operating in another nation’s EEZ are subject to boarding, arrest, and seizure.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Water cannons are actually the more extreme response, as smaller vessels, especially those without sealed decks can quickly become waterlogged and sunk.

Ask the Russian navy who regularly shoot fishermen dead before asking questions.

Not true. Firstly, it's the Coast Guard of the FSB Border Service of Russia.

Secondly, there was one shooting of a crab poacher, clearly in Russian waters, in 2006 after a ramming incident. The previous one before that was way back in 1956, so not "regularly" by any measure. Sensible to apply for a permit.

Very likely that Chinese won't be stay calm after this incident

"Chinese won't stay calm"? It's a fishing boat, not a declaration of war. Maybe they should try staying within their own borders instead of worrying about their "calmness" after getting caught red-handed.

Only economic sanctions and a military response is appropriate for Japan at this point. Anything less is an insult to the Chinese people

"Economic sanctions and military response" for catching a poacher? That isn’t diplomacy; that’s a temper tantrum.

If the "Chinese people" feel insulted by Japan enforcing its own maritime borders, the problem isn't the arrest—it’s the entitlement. Expecting a sovereign nation to ignore illegal incursions just to soothe your ego is peak arrogance.

Real respect is earned by following international law, not by sending fishing fleets to scavenge in waters that don't belong to you and then playing the victim when you get caught. If you want to avoid "insults," tell your skippers to stay in their own lane.

Text: At their meeting in Brussels, NATO ministers will be joined by Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov for the first time since he took office in January. DW has more.

This blog has now closed. Below are the latest updates from Russia's war in Ukraine on Thursday, February 12.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv had sought to back US proposals to end the war with Russia.

Zelenskyy, in an interview published by The Atlantic on Thursday, said Kyiv was willing to hold both a presidential election and a referendum on a deal, but would not settle for an accord that was detrimental to Ukrainian interests.

Plus, Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Olympic skeleton competition for wearing a helmet depicting athletes killed since Russia's invasion despite a last-minute appeal from a tearful IOC president.

Germany will deliver five additional PAC-3 missile interceptors to ‌Ukraine ⁠if ⁠other
countries donate a ​total of 30, German ​Defence Minister ​Boris Pistorius ‌said on Thursday.

PAC-3, or Patriot ‌Advanced Capability-3, is ‌among ​the main weapons the West has supplied ​to Ukraine as it fights ⁠Russia's invasion.

"We ​all ​know it is ​about saving ‌lives," Pistorius said. "It's a ​matter ⁠of days and ⁠not ​a matter of weeks or months."

In a reversal of nearly four years of policy, Ukrainian arms manufacturers were granted export licenses despite the ongoing war with Russia.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, announced the move in a social media post. He did not specify how many enterprises had received a license, but said that Ukraine's annual production capacity in the sector exceeds $55 billion (€46 billion).

"All decisions are under state control and with the unconditional priority of the needs of the Defense Forces," he added.

Since the war began in 2022, Ukraine's defense sector has grown significantly and now includes over 1,000 companies, most of which are new, private-sector enterprises.

"In the ⁠areas of UAVs, electronic warfare and reconnaissance, our capabilities already exceed ⁠the volume ​of domestic procurement," Umerov wrote, using a common abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicles. "Coordinated exports allow us to attract investment, scale up production and launch new technologies for the Ukrainian army."

Kyiv recently made the politically sensitive decision to export weapons amid Russia's full-scale invasion. The country is seeking funds to expand its domestic defense industry while also demanding support from its allies on highly sophisticated weapons, including long-range missiles.


The White House announced that another group of Russian and Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families thanks to the efforts of US First Lady Melania Trump.

Meanwhile, Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's presidential commissioner for children's rights, announced on Telegram that six children were being reunited with their families in Russia and Ukraine.

She added that one child would return to Russia and five children would be reunited with their families in Ukraine. Lvova-Belova thanked Melania Trump for her "unwavering commitment and active participation in reuniting children with their families."

Last August, the US First Lady wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the plight of Ukrainian children separated from their families by the war. Ukraine accuses Russia of abducting thousands of children, a claim that Moscow denies.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lvova-Belova for allegedly illegally deporting hundreds of Ukrainian children.

Russia's state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom, rejected Ukraine's accusation that Russia lacks the equipment and components necessary to operate the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear power station, which Moscow forces occupied in 2022.

Currently, all six of its Soviet-designed VVER-1000 pressurized water reactors are in a "cold shutdown." The plant is a key issue in talks on ending the war, with both Moscow and Kyiv seeking to operate it.

Pavlo Kovtoniuk, the head of the Ukrainian state nuclear firm Energoatom, told the Reuters new agency that Russia lacks the necessary equipment and spare parts to operate the plant. Kovtoniuk said there was a risk of a nuclear accident if Russian officials attempted to restart the reactors.

Kovtoniuk argued that the control equipment and monitoring systems at the plant were Ukrainian, that Russia would have to replace the US fuel in the reactors, and that there was insufficient water to cool the reactors if they were restarted.

But Rosatom categorically rejected those claims.

"Russia operates one of the world's largest nuclear fleets, including ‌VVER-1000 ​units identical to those installed at Zaporizhzhia NPP, and has full capacity to produce equipment, components and nuclear fuel," the company told Reuters.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the International Olympic Committee's decision to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych from the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Heraskevych was disqualified for refusing to wear any helmet other than one honoring Ukrainian athletes killed in the war with Russia.

"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors. Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise," Zelenskyy wrote on X.

The Ukrainian leader expressed his support for Heraskevych and thanked him for his stance.

"We are proud of Vladyslav and of what he did. Having courage is worth more than any medal," Zelenskyy wrote.

Russia has repeatedly violated Olympic principles by exploiting the Games as an opportunity to wage war, he noted. Examples include the 2008 invasion of Georgia, the 2014 occupation of Crimea, and the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

According to Zelenskyy, 660 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russia since the full-scale invasion began.

Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics for refusing to wear a helmet other than the one that honors athletes killed in the war with Russia.

Speaking to DW, Heraskevych said that he still firmly believed that he should have been given the opportunity to compete, he was also considering further pursuing the matter at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The United Nations has urged Russia to cease its assaults on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which have left entire cities in the dark during the harshest winter of the four-year war.

"The relentless attacks by the Russian Federation on energy infrastructure across Ukraine are depriving an already long-suffering civilian population of adequate warmth, water, and electricity in an unbearably bitter and dark winter," said Volker Türk, the UN rights chief, in a statement.

Türk said millions of households are struggling with only a few hours of electricity per day. Unheated schools have been forced to close, and access to medical care has been hindered.

He also noted that as power is painstakingly restored, fresh attacks regularly plunge entire areas back into darkness.

"The targeting of civilian infrastructure is prohibited under international humanitarian law. I call upon the Russian Federation to immediately cease these attacks," Türk stressed.


Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha announced Thursday that Russian oil transit to Eastern Europe via the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba oil pipeline has been suspended since January 27 due to a Russian attack.

"This is the Druzhba pipeline infrastructure burning after the latest Russian strike on January 27, which stopped oil transit," he wrote on X, adding photographs of firefighters against a backdrop of flames.

Sybiha also said  Hungary was preparing to file another complaint about issues with the transit of Russian oil through Druzhba. He advised officials in Budapest to show the photos to their "friends" in Moscow.

On January 27, Ukrainian oil and gas company Naftogaz reported that Russia had attacked one of its facilities in western Ukraine, though it did not specify which. However, local officials in the city of Brody warned the population about pollution from burning oil products.

Brody is where the Druzhba oil pipeline meets the Brody-Odessa pipeline, which was built to connect Druzhba to Black Sea oil terminals.

The United Kingdom will provide Ukraine with more than 500 million pounds (€574 million, $682 million) worth of new defense missiles and systems, the Ministry of Defense announced.

Under the deal, a further 1,000 lightweight multirole missiles manufactured in Belfast will be delivered to Ukraine.

Defense Secretary John Healey also said Britain will contribute 150 million pounds to NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) for the first time. The PURL is a program designed to ensure that air defense missiles reach Ukraine quickly.

Healey stressed Ukraine's allies "are more committed than ever to supporting Ukraine" as Russia's full-scale invasion nears the start of its fifth year.

NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels on Thursday to discuss Europe's defense and ways to support Ukraine. Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov will join NATO ministers for the first time since taking office in January.

After the official NATO meeting, Germany and Britain will lead a gathering of Ukraine's closest allies to collect pledges for new military support.

This meeting follows NATO's announcement that it is increasing its presence in the Arctic and surrounding areas by launching the "Arctic Sentry" mission.

A dispute over Greenland caused a rift between the United States and its European allies, who are under pressure to take on more responsibility as US priorities shift to other regions.


Overnight on Thursday, Russia again attacked Ukraine with drones and ballistic missiles, further damaging its energy system and leaving tens of thousands in the capital, Kyiv, as well as the cities of Dnipro and Odesa, without heat, power, or water, according to officials.

According to Ukraine's air force, Russia launched 24 ballistic missiles, one cruise missile, and 219 drones overnight. Air defenses downed or neutralized 16 missiles and 197 drones.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X that "the main target of the strike was the energy infrastructure in Kyiv, Odesa, and Dnipro." "There is damage in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kyiv, and Kherson regions," he added.

In Kyiv alone, around 3,500 apartment buildings were without heat on Thursday after the latest attack knocked out supplies to nearly 2,600 high-rises, in addition to those already affected by previous strikes, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

Two people were injured in the attack on Kyiv, which also hit a residential building, Klitschko said.

Nearly 300,000 people were left without water when the attack disrupted power supplies in the southern city of Odesa, said Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba. He added that close to 200 buildings in the Black Sea city were left without heating.

In the southeastern industrial city of Dnipro, a combined missile and drone attack wounded four people, including a baby boy and a four-year-old girl, said regional governor Oleksandr Ganzha on Telegram.

Meanwhile, prosecutors said two people were killed and six more wounded in an attack on the railway hub of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region, which borders Russia.

Russia has escalated its winter offensive against Ukraine's electrical infrastructure, leaving major metropolitan areas subject to prolonged periods of freezing temperatures and darkness.


Ukrainian forces carried out overnight attacks on military and energy-related sites in several Russian regions, according to local authorities.

Andrey Bocharov, the governor of the Volgograd region, said the air defense system repelled a missile attack overnight.

"A fire broke out due to falling debris on the territory of a Ministry of Defense building near the village of Kotluban," Bocharov wrote on the regional administration's Telegram channel.

Further north, Russian authorities reported that two people were injured in a separate drone attack in the Tambov region.

Meanwhile, Rostislav Goldshtein, the head of the Komi Republic in Russia's northwestern region, said a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil refinery owned by Lukoil near Ukhta.

In a statement on the Telegram app, he said there were no injuries and that emergency services were on the scene.

On Wednesday, Ukraine's General Staff announced that Ukrainian drones had hit Lukoil's oil refinery in Russia's southern Volgograd region.

Thank you for joining our coverage of the latest developments in Russia's war with Ukraine.

Russia continues to pummel Ukraine's energy infrastructure, while Ukraine launches counterattacks targeting a Russian refinery.

NATO defense ministers are meeting today in Brussels to discuss Europe's defense and ways to support Ukraine. Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov will join them for the first time since taking office in January.

Stay tuned for more news and analysis.

Fox News host Mark Levin heeds warning about the state of Iran, comparing the country to North Korea on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.'

South Korea's espionage agency, the National Intelligence Service, informed lawmakers Thursday that it thinks North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's teenage daughter is near to being set apart as the regime's future leader, The Associated Press reported.

Kim is the third generation of men in his family to rule North Korea.

In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.

"In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that’s quite significant," Lee noted, according to the outlet.

In 2023, South Korea's National Intelligence Service indicated to lawmakers that the North Korean leader and his wife probably had an older son as well as a younger, third child of unknown gender, according to The Associated Press.

North Korea is one of the world's few nuclear-armed nations, making it a unique threat on the global stage.

A 2025 U.S. Intelligence Community Annual Threat Assessment stated, "Kim remains committed to increasing the number of North Korea’s nuclear warheads and improving its missile capabilities to threaten the Homeland and U.S. forces, citizens, and allies, and to weaken U.S. power in the AsiaPacific region, as evidenced by the pace of the North’s missile flight tests and the regime’s public touting of its uranium enrichment capabilities."

"Russia is increasingly supporting North Korea’s nuclear status in exchange for Pyongyang's support to Moscow’s war against Ukraine," the assessment noted.

U.S. allies in NATO said Thursday they believed the crisis over Greenland had passed after the launch of a mission in the Arctic -- and looked to press on with bolstering Europe's role in the alliance.

President Donald Trump's threats against Denmark's autonomous Arctic territory last month plunged the 76-year-old transatlantic alliance into its deepest crisis in years, before he abruptly backed off.

As part of a package to assuage Trump -- who said the U.S. needed to secure the region against a threat from Russia and China -- NATO announced Wednesday the start of an Arctic Sentry mission to increase security in the region.

Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said he was "fully confident that this will also meet the concerns of the United States" at a meeting with counterparts from the 32-nation alliance in Brussels.

But while Europe breathed a sigh of relief about the apparent passing of that storm, the Greenland crisis has only reinforced for many the urgent need for Europe to take a greater role in NATO and its own defence in the face of the threat from Russia.

"What I see today is this mindset shift, where people understand that, yes, it is about spending more, but also it is about a duty of vision that we have to do this together with the United States," said NATO boss Mark Rutte.

That is the message being sent by the Trump administration as well: that Europe needs to step up as Washington pivots to focus on other challenges such as China.

U.S. defense under secretary Elbridge Colby said allies were making strides towards a situation where it is "Europe that leads the conventional defense of NATO" rather than traditionally relying on U.S. military might.

And he said Washington would "continue to press, respectfully but firmly and insistently, for a rebalancing of roles and burdens within the Alliance".

"If Europe rises to this moment," he said, "the alliance will emerge stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for the challenges ahead," Colby told allies at NATO's Brussels headquarters.

To make good on plans for Europe to play a bigger role, NATO needs to make strides on fulfilling the pledge made at its summit last year for countries to massively ramp up defense spending.

Military budgets have already increased since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Trump has spurred on that trend.

"The good news is that the billions are coming in," Rutte said.

He insisted however that he believed the United States would continue to play a central role in defending Europe.

"I predict that longer term, you will see, of course, the nuclear umbrella as the ultimate guarantor of our security here in Europe and Canada, but also a strong conventional presence of the U.S. here in Europe," he said.

In a concrete sign of Europe taking more responsibility within NATO, the alliance this week announced the United States was handing two senior regional command positions to Britain and Italy.

The move was heralded by diplomats as a sign of increased "burden-sharing" within the alliance in action.

French Defense Minister Catherine Vautrin referred to a demand several months back from Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that Europeans must be able to ensure their own security.

"Well, we are going to do it, we have started to do it," she said.

The next crucial staging post will be the NATO summit in Ankara in July when allies will have to convince Trump that they are already doing enough.

"We'll receive our first full report on allied defence spending," the NATO US ambassador Matthew Whitaker said this week.

"We still have some allies that need to step up, particularly those geographically further from NATO's eastern flank. They're not moving as fast as they should, and we really expect them to do more."




It's more like they are going independent from the US despite the fact that the US needs allies to deal with China.

While Trump remains in office Europe most certainly must control and lead NATO.

Definitely a dysfunctional alliance.

Euro bloc satellite economies are stagnant and in decline, so many internal issues. Will be funny to watch their impending comedy of errors.

It's more like they are going independent from the US despite the fact that the US needs allies to deal with China.

It really depends on a few factors

A plushie in the form of a smiling pieróg – Poland’s famous stuffed dumpling – has become a huge hit at the ongoing Winter Olympics in Italy after being adopted as an unofficial mascot of the Polish figure-skating team.

The cooperative for people with disabilities that creates the toy says it has been overwhelmed with orders.

What would @TeamCanada's plushie be? 🤔🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/N0WnO0zZIo

— CBC Olympics (@CBCOlympics) February 6, 2026

The mascot is called “Pieroguszka”, which combines the words pieróg (meaning dumpling, with the plural being pierogi) and poduszka, meaning pillow. It was purchased in Poland and then taken to Italy by a member of the national figure-skating team.

Soon after the team was photographed waving the mascot around, it became an online hit, doing the rounds on social media and prompting comments from journalists, fans and athletes.

It reportedly even attracted the attention of American rap superstar Snoop Dogg, who has been enthusiastically attending the Winter Olympics.

Ekaterina Kurakova, a member of the Polish figure-skating team, told Polish news outlet Interia that the rapper had tried to reach out to the team through intermediaries in the hope of getting himself a Pieroguszka.

The mascot is produced by the Katowice-based “Honolulu Social Cooperative” during handicraft workshops for people with disabilities. Social cooperatives are organisations that combine the functions of a business and an NGO, and are mostly made up of people who are at risk of social exclusion.

“We’ve been around for over 10 years,” the cooperative’s head, Przemysław Sołtysik, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). “Initially, we were a restaurant but, during the pandemic, we had to find something to do in the meantime. So we started sewing Pieroguszkas and opened a shop, which is still operating today.”

“We’re having trouble keeping up with orders,” he added. “We didn’t know this [plushie] was going to Milan, we only saw it in photos. Then the [Polish figure-skating] association contacted us and ordered more, which are now on their way to Milan.”

Pierogi are perhaps the most famous element of Polish cuisine. Eaten boiled or fried, the most common fillings include cheese and potatoes (pierogi ruskie), ground meat (pierogi z mięsem), and mushroom and cabbage (pierogi z kapustą i grzybami).

They can also be eaten in sweet form with fruit inside and served with sour cream and sugar. Savoury pierogi, meanwhile, are often accompanied with fried bacon and onions.

Last year, another Polish sports star helped introduce an element of Polish culinary culture to the world.

On her way to winning the Wimbledon Championships, tennis player Iga Świątek revealed that her favourite post-match meal is pasta with strawberries and yoghurt, prompting many fans to try the traditional Polish summer dish.

Text: MILAN, February 12. /TASS/. President of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Luc Tardif says he wants the national ice hockey teams of Russia and Belarus back on the international stage as soon as possible, The Hockey News web portal reported on Thursday.

"We want Belarus and Russia to come back as soon as possible," Tardif said at a news conference on Thursday. "Because that will mean that the world is getting a little better."

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in turn: "We will follow what the international community is doing in terms of athletics."

"I don't see the need to go in weigh in separately. Frankly, in terms of our game and our players - wherever they are from - if we can steer clear of geopolitical issues, not just this one but a whole host of other ones, I think that's better for our game and it's better for our fans," the NHL chief added.

In February 2022, the IIHF suspended Russia and Belarus from participation in international competitions.

The Russian national ice hockey teams were also barred from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy and Tardif told TASS in 2025 that the decision was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the IIHF had no say in this.

Gordon Brown has demanded that police question Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor regarding his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The former Prime Minister submitted letters to both the Metropolitan Police and Essex Police requesting they launch an investigation into the matter.

Writing in the New Statesman, Mr Brown expressed his alarm at what the recently released Epstein files reveal about Britain's previously unrecognised involvement in the trafficking scandal.

"It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all," the former Labour leader stated.

Mr Brown described himself as "shocked" by the extent of the abuse uncovered in the documents, which detail how Epstein's network operated through British airports and involved UK victims.

Emails contained within the files indicate that British girls were transported on approximately 90 flights departing from UK airports aboard Epstein's aircraft, infamously dubbed the "Lolita Express".

Particularly disturbing is that 15 of these journeys received approval following Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.

"How the flights were allowed to continue should have been fully investigated," Mr Brown wrote.

The documents also expose how Stansted airport served as a hub for trafficking young women from Eastern Europe, with girls brought in from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia.

One email referenced in the files, titled "the girl", reportedly described a victim as "just turned 18, 179cm, very cute, speaks English, I saw her in real 3 years ago i will send you the video in next email".

Mr Brown asserted that at least one of these flights had been directly connected to the former prince, who was stripped of his royal titles last year due to his association with Epstein.

"The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew," he wrote, having formally requested police examine this evidence as part of any new inquiry.

The former Prime Minister also questioned the effectiveness of British authorities, claiming they had "little or no idea who was being trafficked through our country, and for whom other than Epstein".

Appearing in the Epstein files is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and inclusion in the documents does not implicate anyone in Epstein's criminality.

He argued that sexual offences committed on British soil should never be treated as secondary concerns simply because investigations are being conducted elsewhere.

"The evidence suggests some in the UK were complicit in trafficking. This demands a full inquiry," Mr Brown stated.

Mr Brown has urged the Metropolitan Police to urgently reconsider their previous decisions on the case, noting he has been privately informed that earlier investigations failed to properly examine crucial flight evidence.

The Met previously concluded in 2016 that any trafficking inquiry would primarily concern activities outside British jurisdiction, meaning they were not the appropriate body to pursue a full criminal investigation. This position was reviewed in August 2019 but remained unchanged.

Thames Valley Police are currently assessing separate allegations that Andrew shared confidential government reports with Epstein during his time as UK trade envoy, holding discussions with Crown Prosecution Service specialists.

Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson confirmed on Wednesday that prosecutors remain in close contact with both forces but have not yet received a formal request for advice.

Buckingham Palace stated on Monday that it would "stand ready to support" police should they seek assistance with their inquiries into the claims.

A spokesman confirmed that the King had conveyed his "profound concern" regarding the allegations against his younger brother.

Andrew, who remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his princely title and dukedom, has consistently denied any wrongdoing throughout the scandal.

Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, had alleged she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including once in London when she was 17 after being trafficked by Epstein.

The former prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022, which contained no admission of liability.

GB News has contacted Andrew's representatives for comment.

Text: WASHINGTON, February 12. /TASS/. The United States has completed the withdrawal of its forces from the al-Tanf military base in eastern Syria, US officials told Reuters.

As they clarified, the US ceded control of this facility to Syrian troops. The Pentagon has not yet responded to TASS’s request to confirm this information.

As previously reported by the Shafaq News news portal, Syrian military forces began deploying at the al-Tanf base following the departure of the US-led Western coalition forces to Jordanian territory.

The base at al-Tanf, located at the junction of the borders of Jordan, Iraq and Syria, was established by the US-led Western coalition in 2014 to combat the Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia) and allowed for control of the strategic Damascus-Baghdad highway.

Text: MOSCOW, February 12. /TASS/. Moscow and Yerevan will begin negotiations on restoring two Armenian railway segments linking the country to Azerbaijan and Turkey, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk told reporters.

"In accordance with the address of the Armenian side and proceeding from friendly fraternal feelings to the people of Armenia, the Russian Federation made the decision to start specific talks on restoring two segments of Armenian railways that will provide for their joining with railways of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Eraskh area and with railways of the Republic of Turkey in Akhuryan settlement area," Overchuk said.

The total length of railway segments to be restored is about 1.6 km and 12.4 km, the deputy prime minister said. Technical, financial and other modalities for implementation of this project are expected to be determined during talks. "We high value the confidence in Russian experience, competencies and technologies that was demonstrated by the Armenian side when approaching Russia," Overchuk noted. "Restoration of these segments will provide the Russian Federation with the possibility of the direct railway communication with the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan and Turkey with the access to Mediterranean ports and Iran with access to ports of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean," he added.

The work is underway for solving this major task to unblock all disrupted routes in the Caucasus, including an opportunity being considered to restore the rail traffic between Russia and Georgia via the territory of Abkhazia, Overchuk noted. "Strengthening of transport and logistical connectivity in the Caucasus is of critical importance for peace, stability and economic prosperity of the peoples of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Turkey and Russia. We expect constructive interaction of all the countries of the region in solving this important common task," he added.

Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, a likely medal contender at the Milan Cortina Games, was not allowed to compete Thursday after refusing a last-minute plea from the International Olympic Committee to use a helmet other than the one that honors more than 20 of his country's athletes and coaches killed in the war with Russia.

The decision came roughly 45 minutes before the start of the competition, ending a three-day saga where Heraskevych knew he was risking being pulled from the Games by wearing the helmet, which the IOC says breached rules against making statements on the field of play.

In Milan, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the decision was "absolutely not about the message that he wanted to give. It's simply the place. We wanted him before and after to express himself but for that one minute, that one minute of competition, we asked him not to make this expression."

Adams insisted the rules also protected athletes in some countries from being pressured "to express views they may not necessarily agree with."

He added: "That is the only reason. It's not about the message, not at all about the message. It's simply about the sanctity of the field of play."

Heraskevych received written word Thursday from the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, which said his decision to wear the helmet was “inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression.”

He wore the helmet in training, but the IOC asked — pleaded might be the better word — for him to wear a different helmet in races and offered concessions such as the right to wear a black armband or even the ability to display the helmet once he was off the ice.

IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was slated to be in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday to see Alpine skiing, went to the sliding center instead to meet Heraskevych.

She was waiting at the top of the track when he arrived around 8:15 a.m., and they met privately a few minutes later. After about 10 minutes, Coventry was unable to change Heraskevych’s mind.

"As regards the blocking of WhatsApp, our regulators indeed announced such a decision and even implemented it over Meta’s reluctance to abide by the rule and letter of Russian law," he recalled.

Russia’s telecom watchdog Roskomnadzor has explained that it is taking measures to slow down WhatsApp over breaches of Russian law. It claims that the messenger has been used to organize and carry out terrorist activities in the country, and is also one of the main services used to defraud and extort money from citizens.

Peskov has told TASS in an interview that the WhatsApp service can be restored in full if the messenger complies with Russian rules and is ready for dialogue.

Text: More websites and messenger apps are becoming inaccessible in Russia. While users look for ways around government bans, others wonder what will ultimately remain of the internet.

Russia's internet regulator Roskomnadzor has removed"youtube.com" from its DNS (Domain Name System) servers. If a user tries to access the site directly without a VPN (Virtual Private Network), their router can no longer assign the address to its IP address.

This means that You Tube is no longer accessible in Russia. The WhatsApp domain has also disappeared from Roskomnadzor's servers. The Russian government has also launched a campaign against the messenger app Telegram, leading analysts to say Roskomnadzor is cracking down on platforms beyond its control.

If DNS servers are like the internet's phone book, IP addresses are numbers assigned to computers, smartphones and routers to make them accessible and identifiable.


A VPN creates an encrypted connection between a user's device and a server, allowing the user to bypass geo-blocking and surf anonymously.

DW reviewed tips from experts and internet users on how to circumvent Russian blocks. In an anonymous survey, when asked whether they had noticed problems with YouTube in Russia, 46% of respondents told DW they used the video platform via a VPN, 24% reported ongoing connection problems despite using a VPN. Another 27% told DW they did not live in Russia, while 3% said they did not use a VPN and had experienced disruptions.

The DNS servers of Roskomnadzor should actually be referred to as NDNS, or the National Domain Name System, according to internet censorship expert Michael Klimarev, who posted this on the Telegram channel zatelecom.

He said the software and hardware system had been introduced in Russia alongside the Sovereign Internet Law.

"It is an alternative 'internet directory' that Russian telecommunications providers must use," he explained.

He added that according to the law, Russian providers are not allowed to use international domain registrars but only NDNS, enabling the authorities to control access to websites centrally.

According to the na_sviazi Telegram channel, 13 domain names were recently removed from NDNS, including those of DW, BBC, Radio Liberty, Facebook and Instagram.

Until now, Roskomnadzor had primarily used Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to restrict internet access. This data processing technology enables internet traffic to be analyzed and filtered.

DPI can also slow data transmission and ensure videos load slowly or not at all for Russian YouTube users. So, in the past, the video platform was technically available, but did not always work.

Independent telecommunications expert Alexey Uchakin told the business portal of the Russian media group RBC that he presumed Roskomnadzor's capacity to slow down data transmission was limited, and the regulator might have opted for more restrictions to free up its own resources to block Telegram.


In comments on DW's YouTube channel, users reported a deterioration in the quality of access to the internet.

"Even with a VPN, there is a noticeable slowdown and instability," noted one user.

"YouTube is more difficult to watch," said another, adding: "But I don't think that's because of YouTube but because of the VPN. I use free versions."

Another user said they never turned off the VPN on their laptop "because nothing works without it."

Tips on how to circumvent blocks are already being exchanged on social networks in Russia. However, some users fear that the authorities will also be able to detect settings used to circumvent censorship.

Last year, a law that imposes a fine of up to 5,000 rubles (approx. €55 or $65) for searching for "extremist material" on the internet and also using VPNs came into force.

YouTube has not officially been classified as an "undesirable organization" in Russia, but authorities regularly accuse the platform of distributing prohibited content.

"If only one NDNS is available in a country, no settings can help restore normal DNS functionality," says the na_sviazi Telegram channel.

"In this case, a user must seriously consider protecting their data traffic and choose reliable VPNs."

But many users have also complained that even VPNs are not reliable. Some presume this is partly due to restrictions imposed by VPN providers themselves or ad blockers.

Klimarev confirmed VPNs and third-party DNS services did not offer complete protection. He says internet providers could also block alternative DNS services.

For him, a reliable VPN is still the most effective way to stay in touch with the outside world, but he warned that the Russian authorities might falsify IP addresses: "And then you won't be directed to where you want to go."

If a user cannot access genuine websites, they might be directed to fakes designed to steal logins, passwords and bank details.

Officially, Roskomnadzor has justified the restrictions on Telegram by saying the platform has violated "Russian law" and is a "threat to citizens."

A Moscow court already fined Telegram for refusing to delete "prohibited content" and failing to comply with the "obligations of a social media operator."

Klimarev believes that if the situation continues to develop in similar fashion, "at some point, there will be a completely different internet in the Russian Federation that differs from the global one. And it will not be trustworthy."

"Because 2025 was on average 2.5 degrees warmer than usual, our production indicators came in below projections – electricity generation totaled 55.1 bln kWh, 8% below plan, while heat supply amounted to 92.9 mln Gcal, 6% below plan," he said.

Electricity supply in 2026 is also expected to exceed last year’s levels. "This year, we hope to come close to last year’s level. We plan for heat supply across the T-Plus group to increase by approximately 6%, while electricity generation is forecast to grow by around 3%. According to our estimates, electricity production at our plants will total about 57 bln kWh," Snikkars noted.

T-Plus’s core areas of activity include power generation, energy trading, retail operations, and energy services. The company provides energy supply in 16 regions of Russia. Its client base includes more than 14 mln individuals and over 160,000 corporate customers.

Text: WASHINGTON — First lady Melania Trump’s office said Thursday that she played a role in the return of an unspecified number of Ukrainian and Russian children separated from their families during the four-year-old conflict.

Trump “successfully united Russian and Ukrainian children with their families today,” her office said.

“For the third time, the US First Lady has helped facilitate the return of children to their families after they were separated because of the regional conflict.”

The statement did not say how many children of each nationality were affected.

Ukraine’s government says as many as 20,000 children have been taken from homes, orphanages, and boarding schools to Russia since the February 2022 invasion by Moscow — of whom 1,984 have been returned.

The Kremlin claims the children were taken for humanitarian reasons during fighting in eastern Ukraine, though Kyiv says they were abducted to be raised as Russians.

“I appreciate that Russia and Ukraine are dedicated to bringing back the children who have been displaced because of the circumstances surrounding this conflict,” Melania Trump said Thursday.

“Although all parties are cooperating and our communications remain robust, I urge Russia and Ukraine to intensify their efforts to ensure the safe return of every child to their families and guardians.”

The first lady, who is currently promoting a self-titled documentary, announced in October that she established an “open channel” with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss child reunification, leading to the return of eight children and plans for another five.

Her office said in December she helped with seven additional cases.

Melania Trump’s unusual diplomatic role began when President Trump handed Putin a letter she wrote about the children when the two leaders met in Alaska this past August.

Two months later, she summoned White House journalists for a surprise announcement that “President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children.”

The topic has been a key part of dormant peace talks, along with Putin’s demand for territorial concessions and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request for Western military commitments to Ukraine’s defense.

“This is the most difficult issue,” Zelensky said in a December interview with a Polish news outlet. “It is very important that our partners raise it … If we don’t talk about it, Russia will do everything to make this issue be forgotten.”

Fedorov also called on all partners not only to support Ukraine but to significantly increase sanctions pressure on Russia.

"It is important to restrict the activities of Russia's shadow fleet, to stop all Russian tankers. Only in this way will Russia no longer be able to sustain this war. The decisions made here matter. They determine whether Ukrainian cities will be protected, whether civilians will survive, and whether peace will come closer or recede. Let's be technological. Let's be creative. Let's be resilient," Fedorov urged, adding that he expects strong contributions from partners following the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting.

Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych pushed at the limits of the International Olympic Committee's rules on freedom of expression, and the global sports body pushed back. That created an emotional and historic moment of Winter Games lore.

Heraskevych insisted on wearing a helmet in competition with the images of Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed during Russia's nearly 4-year-old full-scale invasion of their country. By refusing to back down, he was disqualified from his Olympic event Thursday.

He defied a last-minute plea by IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was in tears after their early morning meeting at the sliding center in Cortina d’Ampezzo. Although disqualified from the competition, Heraskevych was not expelled from the Olympics, unlike previous athletes who staged prominent protests.

A look at the Olympic rules and previous protests:

Heraskevych had freely worn his preferred helmet on training runs, and the IOC told him he could bring it to media areas on race days.

For the actual race, however, he refused to wear an approved helmet that complied with IOC rules designed to keep the field of competition clean of political messages. Heraskevych also refused proposed IOC compromises of wearing a black armband or displaying the helmet once he was off the course.

Political neutrality is a foundational principle of the Olympic Charter, a 108-page document of 61 articles that effectively serves as the constitution of the IOC and the Olympic Games.

Rule 50 states: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”

In addition, Rule 40 states that athletes comply with “conditions of participation established by the IOC,” including where and how free expression can be displayed.

“It is not at all about the message,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a daily news conference dominated by the helmet issue. “It is simply about the sanctity of the field of play.”

Sports law expert Antoine Duval told The Associated Press it was “a huge move” for the IOC to cite Rule 40 on free expression and not the one on political propaganda.

“That is demanding that athletes are like absolute robots,” said Duval of the Asser Institute in the Netherlands, suggesting future Olympians could face scrutiny over their tattoos.

Heraskevych, 27, is at his third Winter Games and the second under the shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine, which began Feb. 24, 2022 — four days after the end of the Beijing Winter Games.

On Feb. 11 of that year, Heraskevych completed his races in China and held a small sign for the TV cameras in the blue and yellow colors of his national flag with the slogan, “No War in Ukraine.”

The IOC took no action against him, deciding this was “a general call for peace” and not an explicitly political statement.

He returned to the Olympics this year, with no end to the war in sight, and he again tried to state his views.

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

The risks of the competition being overshadowed by political statements could be even greater at the larger Summer Games like those in 2028 in Los Angeles, when the IOC wants 206 national Olympic teams, plus a refugee team, to take part.

“Think of the Middle East, think of Africa, think of South America, if everyone is allowed to express themselves in that way beyond a black armband,” Adams said “You can see where that would lead to a chaotic situation.”

The IOC says its athlete expression rules were drafted after consulting with officially recognized athlete groups, including some from countries where they face political interference.

“We cannot have athletes having pressure put on them by their political masters to make messaging during the competition,” Adams said.

A regular concern at Summer Games in recent years has been the issue of some athletes seeming to be pulled from competition to avoid facing an opponent from Israel.

The last major review of protest guidelines was overseen by Coventry while she was an IOC athlete representative ahead of the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.

Stricter rules were in place but eased just weeks before those Games, in which women's soccer teams took a knee before the first whistle to support racial justice.

Heraskevych’s case has been compared to U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov, who made an emotional tribute in Milan this week. After his skate, he displayed a photo of himself as a child with his parents, who were killed in January 2025 when American Airlines Flight 5342 struck a military helicopter on approach to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River.

Adams said Naumov's display was “a spontaneous show of emotion” after his event.

At the Paris Olympics 18 months ago, Afghan refugee Manizha Talash competed in the breaking competition wearing a cape with the slogan, “Free Afghan Women.” She was disqualified by the World DanceSport Federation.

Also in Paris, the opening ceremony saw a memorial gesture in which Algerian athletes tossed red roses from their boat into the Seine at the spot where in 1961 dozens of protesters died in a police crackdown.

Perhaps the most famous demonstration came at the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City when U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood atop the medal podium after the 200 meters race. Shoeless and with their heads bowed, the two Black Americans each raised a gloved fist to protest racial injustice. They were expelled from the Games but allowed to keep their medals.

The helmet issue has put Ukraine back in the Olympic news at what could be the last games before Russia returns to the IOC fold. Russian athletes and teams have faced varying restrictions on competing — without their national identity of flag, anthem and colors — at each Olympics in the past decade because of doping scandals and the war.

The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 for breaking the Olympic Charter by incorporating sports councils in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed. The legal dispute is under review, and the IOC advised sports governing bodies in December to look at restoring Russian youth teams to international competitions with their full identity.

Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi has urged the IOC not to make concessions before the war ends.

MILAN (AP) -- Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych pushed at the limits of the International Olympic Committee's rules on freedom of expression, and the global sports body pushed back. That created an emotional and historic moment of Winter Games lore.

Heraskevych and the Olympic rules

Heraskevych had freely worn his preferred helmet on training runs, and the IOC told him he could bring it to media areas on race days.

For the actual race, however, he refused to wear an approved helmet that complied with IOC rules designed to keep the field of competition clean of political messages. Heraskevych also refused proposed IOC compromises of wearing a black armband or displaying the helmet once he was off the course.

Text: Russia has attempted to fully block WhatsApp in the country, the company said, the latest move in an ongoing government effort to tighten control over the internet.

A WhatsApp spokesperson said late Wednesday that the Russian authorities’ action was intended to “drive users to a state-owned surveillance app,” a reference to Russia’s own state-supported MAX messaging app that’s seen by critics as a surveillance tool.

“Trying to isolate over 100 million people from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,” the WhatsApp spokesperson said. “We continue to do everything we can to keep people connected.”

Russia’s government has already blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, and ramped up other online restrictions since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms should comply with Russian law to see it unblocked, according to the state Tass news agency.

Earlier this week, Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it will introduce new restrictions on the Telegram messaging app after accusing it of refusing to abide by the law.

The move triggered widespread criticism from military bloggers, who warned that Telegram was widely used by Russian troops fighting in Ukraine and its throttling would derail military communications.

Despite the announcement, Telegram has largely been working normally. Some experts say it’s a more difficult target compared with WhatsApp.

Some Russian experts said that blocking WhatsApp would free up technological resources and allow authorities to fully focus on Telegram, their priority target.

Authorities had previously restricted access to WhatsApp before moving to finally banning it on Wednesday.

Under President Vladimir Putin, authorities have engaged in deliberate and multipronged efforts to rein in the internet.

They have adopted restrictive laws and banned websites and platforms that don’t comply, and focused on improving technology to monitor and manipulate online traffic.

Russian authorities have throttled YouTube and methodically ramped up restrictions against popular messaging platforms, blocking Signal and Viber and banning online calls on WhatsApp and Telegram.

In December, they imposed restrictions on Apple’s video calling service FaceTime.

While it’s still possible to circumvent some of the restrictions by using virtual private network services, many of them are routinely blocked, too.

At the same time, authorities actively promoted the “national” messaging app called MAX, which critics say could be used for surveillance.

The platform, touted by developers and officials as a one-stop shop for messaging, online government services, making payments, and more, openly declares it will share user data with authorities upon request.

Experts also say it doesn’t use end-to-end encryption.

Text: Following a meeting with the head of the International Olympic Committee, Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Winter Games over his 'helmet of remembrance.'

Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics on Thursday for refusing to wear a different helmet than the one that honors athletes killed in the war with Russia.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Kirsty Coventry informed him of his disqualification in a meeting early Thursday at the sliding venue.

Coventry was waiting for Heraskevych at the top of the track when he arrived at around 8:15 a.m., about 75 minutes before the start of the men's skeleton race.

They went into a private area and spoke briefly. Apparently, however, Coventry was unable to convince Heraskevych to agree to race while wearing a different helmet.

Speaking to German public broacaster ZDF minutes after the decision, Heraskevych insisted that his disqualification was unjust.

"I have repeated this from Day 1; I don't think it violates any rules. In accordance with Rule 50 we don't have any political propaganda, we don't have any racial propaganda, and we don't have any harassment towards anyone on this helmet. So I believe this helmet didn't (break) any rules," he said.

The Olympic Charter rule that Heraskevych referred to states that: "No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas."

He also asserted that despite the fact that he had finished well out of the medals at the 2018 and 2022 Winter Games, he would have been in the hunt for a place on the podium on Friday.

"The last days were good training (sessions) for me, I was fast, I was among the best athletes,  and I could have been a medalist tomorrow," Heraskevych said.

"But we will never know, because my Olympic moment was stolen."

He again stressed that he believed it was his right to "represent these athletes who died" because it was also due to their sacrifice that he was able to be there.

"This is more important than winning a medal," he said.

Speaking later to DW, Heraskevych said the past few days had been very tiring, but he still firmly believed that he should have been given the opportunity to compete – and was looking at pursuing the matter at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

"It's frustrating. We put a lot of effort and training in over four years. This was also at a time of a full-scale war, so it was under very hard circumstances."

He also said he found it difficult to understand why the IOC had taken the stand it has.

"If (the) IOC reacts in a way with common sense, we will not have this terrible scandal now," he said.

"And then there is much less politics in this competition and also much more attention (being paid) to the athletes in the competition now."

Following her meeting with Heraskevych, Coventry also spoke with reporters. She was visibly emotional, with tears rolling down her face as she spoke.

"It's a message of memory and no one is disagreeing with that," she said.

The IOC stated that it made its decision "with regret."

"Despite multiple exchanges and in-person meetings between the IOC and Mr Heraskevych, the last one this morning with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, he did not consider any form of compromise," the IOC said in a statement.

"The IOC was very keen for Mr Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The essence of this case is not about the message, it is about where he wanted to express it," the statement added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy swiftly criticized the IOC decision, saying it ​contradicted the spirit of the ​Games.

"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, ​and ‌the Olympic movement should help stop wars, ‌not play into the ‌hands ​of aggressors," he wrote on X.

Heraskevych came to the Milano Cortina Olympics with a customized helmet displaying the faces of over 20 Ukrainian athletes and coaches who were killed in the war between Russia and Ukraine.

On Tuesday, the IOC announced that the helmet would not be permitted during the competition, citing a rule prohibiting political statements on the Olympic field of play.  It offered a compromise solution allowing the athlete to wear a black armband instead but Heraskevych did not want to back down.

He wore a helmet during training on Tuesday and Wednesday, knowing that the IOC could ultimately disqualify him from the Olympic race.

At the last Olympics in Beijing in 2022, Heraskevych displayed a banner that read, "No War in Ukraine." Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four days after those Olympics ended.

Russia announced Thursday it had blocked WhatsApp over its alleged failure to comply with Russian legislation, days after restricting access to rival messaging service Telegram for similar reasons.

Moscow has for months been trying to shift users onto Max, a domestic messaging service that lacks end-to-end encryption and which activists have called a potential surveillance tool.

Critics say the restrictions are part of a broader campaign by Russian authorities to tighten control over internet use and more easily monitor Russian citizens online.

Here's what we know about both apps and Russia's attempts to push users onto Max.

WhatsApp

WhatsApp, which has over 100 million users in Russia, is owned by US tech giant Meta.

The app was the most popular messaging service among Russians aged 25 and over in 2023, while Telegram was more popular among younger users, according to a report by Russian news outlet RBK.

Russia announced it was blocking calls on both applications last August, accusing them of facilitating crime.

It has since progressively slowed down WhatsApp and in November announced it would ban the platform outright unless it complied with Russian legislation.

Russia has asked for both messengers to provide access to data when requested by law enforcement for fraud probes and for investigating activities Russia describes as "terrorist".

Rights advocates fear that would extend Russia's surveillance state and could be used to target critics of the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin or the war in Ukraine.

WhatsApp said Wednesday that Russia had finally "attempted to fully block" the service, which the Kremlin confirmed on Thursday.

It was unclear how widespread or effective Russia's attempts were.

VPN users in Russia still seem able to circumvent the ban.

Telegram

Telegram, founded by Russian-born entrepreneur Pavel Durov, is the most popular messaging service in Russia, boasting more than one billion monthly active users worldwide.

Russia's internet watchdog announced it was throttling access to the app on Tuesday, accusing it of failing to follow legislation.

It was not immediately clear if Russia planned to ban the application outright.

Russian officials -- including the Kremlin -- still use it to issue statements and it is the most popular outlet for pro-government military bloggers commenting on the Ukraine war.

Some have warned that blocking the app would hobble communications around the front line and in Russian-occupied territory.

Durov, who now lives outside Russia, has called the Kremlin's restrictions "an attempt to force its citizens to switch to a state-controlled app built for surveillance and political censorship".

He has clashed with the Russian authorities before.

He was forced out of the VK social media site he founded -- a Russian equivalent of Facebook -- under pressure from the authorities.

Russia spent two years trying to block Telegram, but having failed either to restrict access or to stop the growth of the service, it lifted the ban in 2020.

Max

Max, released by Russian social media giant VK last year, has been touted as a "super app" -- capable of doing everything from accessing government services to ordering a pizza, similar to China's WeChat or Alipay.

The government directed manufacturers to include it on all new phones and tablets starting last September, and it claimed 75 million users by December.

But it has been met with skepticism from some Russians, some of whom have told AFP they were forced to download it by their employers.

Unlike WhatsApp, Max appears to lack end-to-end encryption, meaning messages are not scrambled while traveling between the reader and sender and could possibly be retained by the state.

Sarkis Darbinyan, co-founder of digital rights NGO Roskomsvoboda, told AFP last year that shifting users onto Max could also allow authorities to limit information it does not want users to see.

Russia is moving people to a "kind of vacuum, where they do not have that undesirable information", he said.

Text: WASHINGTON, February 12. /TASS/. The US administration is expected to announce a reconstruction plan for Gaza and clarify plans for an international stabilization force for the enclave at a Board of Peace meeting set for February 19, Reuters reported.

According to Washington officials, a central part of the meeting will be US President Donald Trump’s announcement of "a multi-billion-dollar fund" for Gaza, which will include monetary contributions from participating board members. One official described the offers as "generous" but noted that the US had not made any explicit requests for donations. "People have come to us offering," the official said, as cited by the news agency.

The US will also announce that a number of countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilization force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead, the officials said.

According to Reuters, delegations from at least 20 countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting.


Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that Moscow was working to develop a position on the Board of Peace, taking into account the cautious approach that many countries in the West and the East had adopted to the initiative. President Vladimir Putin stated earlier that Russia was ready to spend $1 billion from its assets frozen in the US on the Board of Peace. He said Moscow was willing to do so even before it decided whether or not it would join the initiative.

UNITED NATIONS: Iran’s election as vice-chair of the United Nations Commission for Social Development is being slammed by human rights advocates and policy analysts, who have condemned the U.N.'s hypocrisy when it comes to its treatment of undemocratic regimes.

The leadership role was approved without objection during a meeting of the commission, where delegates adopted agenda items and organizational decisions by consensus.

The United Nations has faced continued criticism over its inaction towards the regime's violent crackdown against protesters in December and January. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres faced criticism for congratulating Iran on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

UN CHIEF BLASTED AS ‘ABJECTLY TONE-DEAF’ OVER MESSAGE TO IRAN MARKING REVOLUTION ANNIVERSARY


U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz criticized the development, writing on X: "Yet another reason why we are not a member of, nor do we participate in, this ridiculous ‘Commission for Social Development.’"

Alireza Jafarzadeh, author of The Iran Threat and deputy director of the U.S. office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, also criticized the decision. "Having the Iranian regime in the leadership of a U.N. body tasked with promoting democracy, gender equality, tolerance and non-violence is appalling and like fox guarding the hen house," Jafarzadeh said. "The vast majority of the Iranian people are calling for regime change because the mullahs are the world’s leading human rights violators, misogynist to the core, and they slaughter the voices of dissent by thousands."

He argued that Iran should face scrutiny rather than institutional advancement. "Instead, the Iranian regime must be a subject of intense investigation and accountability by all U.N. bodies for crimes against humanity and genocide, from the 1980s to January 2026 uprisings," Jafarzadeh said. "Decades of inaction by Western governments have emboldened the regime. This must stop now."

"By electing Iran to help lead a commission devoted to democracy, women’s rights and non-violence, the U.N. makes itself into a mockery," said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch. "This is a regime that brutalizes women for not covering their hair, and that just massacred tens of thousands of its own civilians in two days."

Neuer argued that governments had the ability to block the appointment but chose not to act. "The EU states know how to stop abusive regimes from winning these seats — they’ve done so in the recent past with Russia — but this time on Iran, they chose silence and complicity," he said. "By rewarding the Mullahs right after their slaughter of innocents, the U.N. has now sent a very dangerous message to Tehran."

Lisa Daftari, an Iran analyst, said the optics of Iran holding a leadership role in a commission centered on social development and rights were deeply troubling.



"For Iranian women who risk prison or worse just for taking off a headscarf, watching Tehran get a vice-chair on a U.N. social-development commission feels like a slap in the face."

She added that broader patterns in U.N. voting and resolutions contribute to perceptions of bias.

"When the same U.N. system has spent the last decade passing roughly 170-plus resolutions against Israel and only around 80 on all other countries combined, you don’t need a PhD to see there’s a bias problem," Daftari said. "When the U.N. has churned out well over a hundred anti-Israel resolutions in recent years while managing a fraction of that number on the world’s worst dictatorships, it looks less like moral leadership and more like political theater."


Protesters burn images of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally held in Solidarity with Iran's Uprising, organized by The national Council of Resistance of Iran, on Whitehall in central London Jan. 11, 2026, to protest against the Iranian regime's crackdown on internet access and "recognise their right to self-defense against the regime's forces".  (Carlos Jasso/AFP via Getty Images)

Daftari rejected that procedural nature of United Nations committees and committees.

"Some diplomats will wave this away as a procedural formality, but at the U.N. nothing is ever purely symbolic," she said. "The bottom line is that handing Iran’s regime a gavel on ‘social development’ confirms yet again that the place is biased and deeply hypocritical."

US defence giant Northrop Grumman and Polish arms manufacturer Niewiadów-PGM have announced plans to jointly produce over 180,000 155-mm artillery shells annually in Poland.

The endeavour aims to meet growing demand for ammunition in Europe, including potentially supplying Ukraine, while also catering to the US market.

— Niewiadów Polska Grupa Militarna (@grupaniewiadow) February 11, 2026

On Tuesday, Niewiadów announced the adoption of a framework agreement with Northrop Grumman, which follows a memorandum of understanding signed last year.

“Northrop Grumman brings its experience in the design and production of artillery ammunition and advanced manufacturing technologies, while companies belonging to the Niewiadów group contribute expertise in handloading, assembly, and final product integration,” said the Polish firm.

In comments to Reuters on Wednesday, Northrop Grumman’s managing director for Poland, Quinn Canole, said that “Poland was a natural location” to help internationalise Northrop Grumman’s technology.

He revealed that production of so-called “qualification rounds”, which are meant for testing purposes, would start “definitely inside this year”, with the aim of then ramping up output to reach a target of more than 180,000 155-mm artillery shells a year.

Mirosław Klepaczewski, head of Elaboracja Niewiadów, a subsidiary group, said on Tuesday that the new agreement demonstrates the partners’ ability to “effectively respond to the growing demand for artillery ammunition in Europe”.

However, Canole confirmed to Reuters that production would cater to the US market as well as Europe. She also did not rule out Ukraine as a potential client. Such shells are widely used by Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression, but have been in short supply.

Polish state defence group @PGZ_pl has formed a strategic partnership with Britain's @BAESystemsplc to produce 155mm artillery shells.

The deal will see BAE Systems transfer "technology and know-how" for Poland to produce the ammunition domestically https://t.co/nT77RCGZog

— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 12, 2025

In March last year, the head of then-President Andrzej Duda’s National Security Bureau caused concern when he warned that Poland only had enough ammunition to defend itself “for a week or two” if it were attacked by Russia. However, his claims were rejected as untrue by the government.

Nevertheless, Poland has been since been seeking to increase its domestic ammunition production capacity. In 2024, a special law was passed granting defence firms up to 3 billion zloty (€712 million) to invest in such production.

Last year, state defence group Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa (PGZ) similarly launched a partnership with Britain’s BAE Systems to produce 155-mm artillery shells.

Prime Minister Tusk said at the time that the deal was part of government plans to increase the production of large-calibre shells to 130,000 annually within two years.

Poland has increased the production of small-calibre ammunition fivefold – to one million bullets a day – at state-owned defence firm Mesko following the opening of a new production facility https://t.co/kcGh7EDT54

— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) June 16, 2025

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Poland has significantly increased its wider defence spending, including making large-scale purchases from the United States and South Korea of tanks, self-propelled howitzers and aircraft, among other hardware.

Poland is currently NATO’s largest relative defence spender, with its defence budget set to reach 4.8% of GDP this year. Spending began to rise under the former Law and Justice (PiS) government but has continued to expand under the current ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

Text: The IOC has disqualified Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych for wearing a helmet that features images of athletes killed in the war on Ukraine during competition. DW has what you need to know.



Heraskevych finished 12th in 2018 and 18th in 2022 but there had been some suggestions he would have been among the medal contenders this time.

Heraskevych wanted to wear his "helmet of remembrance" not only in training but also during the Olympic race in Cortina. It features images of Ukrainian athletes who were killed during Russia's war on Ukraine.


Announcing his disqualification shortly before he was due to race on Thursday, the IOC said: "The decision followed his refusal to comply with the IOC’s Guidelines on Athlete Expression. It was taken by the jury of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation based on the fact that the helmet he intended to wear was not compliant with the rules."

In 2020, the IOC Athletes' Commission published guidelines on how to implement the relevant rule. According to these guidelines, athletes should only be allowed to express political views during the Olympic Games at press conferences, in interviews in the mixed zones, at team meetings, on social media or through media outlets.





The IOC initially said that he had, "with regret" been stripped of his accreditation for the Games and had to leave the Olympic Village immediately. It later rescinded that decision, saying the U-turn had come at the request of IOC President Kirsty Coventry.

Heraskevych told reporters at the track: "It’s hard to say or put into words. It’s emptiness." but added that he would appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. But any chance of a medal has clearly gone, with the competition beginning without the Ukrainian athlete.

Heraskevych has received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On X, he wrote that it ​contradicted the spirit of the ​Games.

"Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, ​and ‌the Olympic movement should help stop wars, ‌not play into the ‌hands ​of aggressors," he wrote.

While the IOC have implemented the ban, Coventry had tears running down her face when she spoke of the decision.

"No one, especially me, is disagreeing with the messaging, it’s a powerful message, it’s a message of remembrance, of memory. The challenge was to find a solution for the field of play. Sadly we’ve not been able to find that solution” she said "I really wanted to see him race, It’s been an emotional morning."

Germany's three-time Olympic luge gold medalist Felix Loch expressed regret at the decision.

"It's a shame that he can't fulfil his Olympic dream here," Loch told the DPA news agency.

"But the rules are clear. Now the matter has received more attention than if he had competed normally."

Heraskevych, who has always been active in promoting his cause on social media posted a picture of him wearing the helmet with the phrase: "This is price of our dignity."

This article was originally published in German and updated after Heraskevych was formally disqualified on February 12.

Text: Africa's heads of state are gathering in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for their annual meeting this weekend at a time when the continent's place in the world appears to be in flux.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney, speaking in Davos last month, described an arresting image of the future of international relations: either countries were at the table or they were on the menu.

For Africa's leaders, who for years have been arguing that they should be dining at the top table, it was not an unfamiliar analogy.

But in his second term, US President Donald Trump has accelerated the trend towards great-power domination of world affairs and the ditching of multilateralism.

As the White House's updated security strategy says, not every region in the world can get equal attention. Trump's pivot towards the Western hemisphere, as well as time spent on the Middle East, has implied less focus on Africa.

The less powerful nations, who may have once relied on the norms, as well as the finance, of global bodies such as the UN, World Bank or World Trade Organization, are now having to re-evaluate relationships.

These moves have given fresh urgency to the question of how the continent should deal with the rest of the world.

For Tighisti Amare, director of the Africa programme at the UK-based Chatham House think-tank, there is a danger that African countries will be "left behind" if they fail to develop an effective common strategy.

But already, for the US, there is a menu full of tempting bilateral deals involving minerals and natural resources, which bypass any opportunity for collective bargaining on the part of the continent.

When it comes to Africa, the policy shift reflected in pronouncements from Washington is dizzying.

A little over three years ago, then-President Joe Biden told the continent's leaders at a summit in the US capital, that "the United States is all-in on Africa's future".

This followed a White House strategy document on sub-Saharan Africa which described the region as "critical to advancing our global priorities".

Critics, however, have questioned whether this really did penetrate the Oval Office, with Biden's only visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president - to Cape Verde, briefly, and Angola - coming in the last full month of his term.

In contrast to the official statements from his predecessor, Trump's America First approach has a much narrower idea of US interests.

"We cannot afford to be equally attentive to every region and every problem in the world," the White House's National Security Strategy stated last November.

The three paragraphs on Africa at the end spoke about partnering with "select countries to ameliorate conflict, foster mutually beneficial trade relationships" and move from supplying aid to encouraging investment and economic growth.

For Peter Pham, who was a special envoy to Africa during Trump's first administration, this is a more honest approach.

"I was trained in the realist school of international relations," he told the BBC, "and I'm not delusional enough to think that Africa is front and centre of US interests as much as it's maybe front and centre of my life.

"There's no way any country, even a superpower, can be all things to everyone. The reality is we don't have the bandwidth nor the resources, as generous as the American people have been, to do everything for everyone.

"So we have to husband those resources and steward them as best we can to achieve the optimal outcome for obviously our own citizens, but also our partners writ large."

One of the clearest expressions of this was the minerals deal that the US struck with the Democratic Republic of Congo in December, which happened in tandem with the signing of a peace deal with Rwanda.

It was aimed at "building secure, reliable and durable supply chains for critical minerals" for the US, according to the text, as well as encouraging investment in DR Congo, which has huge reserves of minerals essential for the manufacture of electronic goods.

Pham himself is part of another deal as he is chairman of Ivanhoe Atlantic a company involved in the development of the "Liberty Corridor", a project building new infrastructure linking Guinea's vast iron ore mines to a Liberian port to boost exports of the raw material.

Ken Opalo, an Africa specialist at Georgetown University's school of foreign service in Washington, is worried that the US's transactional, bilateral approach "means that the bargaining position for African countries will be terribly weak and therefore they may not get the best deals possible".

He told the BBC that if "the DR Congo example is anything to go by, the US focus on minerals is about merely securing mining rights for American companies and little else in terms of the broader economic co-operation, which is not what the region needs.

"The region needs deeper market access, investment treaties and the ability to attract US capital for all sectors not just mining."

DR Congo's Mines Minister Louis Watum Kabamba dismissed these concerns. Speaking at a mining summit in Cape Town this week, he said his country was not going to "sell everything for nothing to America".

Of course, the US is not the only big power involved. China, for more than a decade, outspent the US in terms of foreign direct investment in Africa, though this position was reversed last year.

Other countries, such as Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are also striking their own investment and security deals.

The transactional approach is not necessarily bad, Opalo said, but he argued that there is not the strategic depth of thinking going on, or diplomatic expertise, in African governments "to play this game well". This means leaders may go for easy wins without considering the long-term implications, he feared.

On the security front, Africa's failure to resolve the civil war in Sudan, triggering what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis, could be seen as an example of this, Opalo added.

Despite its officially neutral stance, Turkey has been accused of supplying the Sudanese army with weapons. Iran and Russia also face the same accusation. All have been met with denials, but last February Russia signed a deal with Sudan's military government to set up a naval base in the country.

On the other side, the UAE has been accused of backing the Rapid Support Forces, which it also denies.

"The failure to sort Sudan out is symptomatic of the lack of agency that the continent has," Opalo said.

Ghana's President John Mahama, for one, is trying to shift this assessment.

Mahama, like Carney, also spoke at the Swiss ski resort Davos.

He said that with "an unpredictable ally across the Atlantic" and shrinking development assistance, the world was at an "inflexion point".

"Africa must pull itself up by its own bootstraps," he argued.

In a passionate address he declared that the continent had lost its sovereignty and was caught in a dependency trap. This was true both in areas of aid spending - such as health and education - as well as security matters, he said, adding that when it comes to natural resources, "we supply the world's critical minerals but capture almost none of the value".

The president's prescription, through his Accra Reset project, is more investment in relevant skills, co-ordinated industrialisation across Africa's regions and joined-up continental negotiation with outside partners.

But these are calls that have been heard before and the question is whether there is a greater chance now that something will change.

For analyst Tighisti the "key challenge is that to create a united front, leaders should be more focused on regional interests. Sometimes this means that national interests have to be put aside if they really want agency in international negotiations."

In his Davos speech, the Canadian prime minister called for the world's "middle powers" to act together. In Africa these could include Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa.

But Tighisti said that while "these are the countries that everyone is looking up to, there is a lack of continental leadership to really push the integration agenda".

One key problem is that many leaders are very inward-facing, as "they themselves have huge domestic challenges that they need to address at the same time".

She added that there was already the framework for countries to work more closely through things such as the continent's free trade area - a project aimed at boosting commerce between African countries  - and the African Union's Agenda 2063, described as a master plan for transforming the continent, but progress on these has been slow.

Laying out his pitch in Switzerland, Mahama said that "Africa intends to be at the table in determining what that new global order will look like".

But there is still a lot of work to do to get the most out of the shift in US foreign policy as well as the continent's other partners – the dinner invitations are not yet being sent out.

Feb 13 - Ukrainian drones hit residential houses and industrial facilities in the southern Russian region of Volgograd, injuring several people, the regional governor said on Friday.

Ukraine and Russia have intensified drone and missile strikes as U.S.-brokered peace talks have failed to yield tangible results.

Ukrainian officials said Russia pounded Ukraine with drones and ballistic missiles overnight on Thursday, further battering its energy system and leaving tens of thousands in the capital Kyiv and the cities of Dnipro and Odesa without heat, power and water.

The Volgograd region governor, Andrei Bocharov, said on the Telegram messaging app that several private houses and cars were damaged in Volgograd and adjacent districts, and three people were rushed to hospital.

He also said drones hit some industrial enterprises in the city and the region, without providing details.

Industry sources told Reuters that Lukoil-owned Volgograd oil refinery, which accounts for around 5% of Russia's total oil refining capabilities, suspended oil processing on Wednesday after fire erupted following a Ukrainian done attack. REUTERS

Summary


Published Feb 13, 2026, 12:29 AM

Updated Feb 13, 2026, 12:29 AM

KYIV - A January attack by Russia on the Ukrainian branch of the Soviet-built Druzhba oil pipeline halted the transit of Russian oil to Eastern Europe, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Feb 12.

Despite its nearly four-year-long war with Russia, Ukraine continues to transport Russian oil to Slovakia and Hungary even though it

stopped the transit of Russian gas

Ukrainian oil and gas company Naftogaz reported on Jan 27 that Russia had attacked one of its facilities in eastern Ukraine but did not specify which one.

However, city officials in Brody, where Druzhba meets the Brody-Odesa oil pipeline, warned the population about pollution from burning oil products and Mr Sybiha posted on X a picture of firefighters against a backdrop of flames.

“This is the Druzhba pipeline infrastructure burning after the latest targeted Russian strike on January 27th, which stopped oil transit.”

The strike was a rare case of Russian forces attacking an oil pipeline through which Russia supplies oil to Europe.

Ukraine, however, has repeatedly

attacked Druzhba on Russian territory.

While past stoppages have met with protests from Budapest and Bratislava, there were no reports from Ukraine, Hungary or Slovakia about any problems with oil supplies in recent weeks.

“Hungary made no protest to Russia about it. They could not even pronounce the word ‘Russia’. Double standards at their best,” Mr Sybiha said in his post.

Responding to his remarks, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto suggested Kyiv was responsible for blocking electricity supplies for the operation of the pipeline. “Why don’t you ask your President when he will allow to restore the electricity supply of the pipeline?” Mr Szijjarto said on X.

Since autumn, Russia has sharply intensified its missile and drone strikes on Ukraine’s energy sector, and entire regions’ populations and businesses have been cut off from energy supplies for many hours following attacks on power stations. REUTERS

Text: Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation to the Munich Security Conference this week

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a large U.S. delegation this week to the Munich Security Conference where increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump’s often inconsistent policies and threats that have roiled transatlantic relations and the post-World War II international order.

A year after Vice President JD Vance stunned assembled dignitaries at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America’s closest allies in Europe, accusing them of imperiling Western civilization with left-leaning domestic programs and not taking responsibility for their own defense, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering of world leaders and national security officials Saturday, U.S. officials say.

The State Department’s formal announcement of Rubio’s trip offered no details about his two-day stop in Munich, after which he will visit Slovakia and Hungary. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the trip, said America's top diplomat intends to focus on areas of cooperation on shared global and regional concerns, including in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as China, an economic powerhouse seeking to take advantage of the uncertainty in U.S.-European ties.

Should that be the case, many in the audience may be relieved after being buffeted first by Vance’s blunt rebukes last year and then a series of Trump statements and moves in the months since that have targeted virtually every country in Europe, Canada and long-standing allies in the Indo-Pacific.

Trump’s recent comments about taking control of Greenland from NATO member Denmark and insults hurled at various leaders were particularly unnerving, leading many in Europe to question the value of the U.S. as an ally and partner.

That leaves Rubio with a heavy lift if he wants to calm the waters.

Vance's speech last year was “really a shock moment,” said Claudia Major, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “It was perceived as the first very clear statement of what the new Trump administration was about," namely that “Europeans are not partners any longer.”

“There is a big doubt whether the basis (of trust) is still there and whether we still share the same vision for the trans-Atlantic relationship,” she said. “The longer this kind of estrangement goes, the more difficult it will be to re-find a solid relationship.”

Munich Security Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger offered a similar view.

“Transatlantic relations are currently in a significant crisis of confidence and credibility,” he said this week. But he also expressed hope that Rubio and the dozens of U.S. lawmakers expected to attend the meeting will offer a less dire and dour prognosis for the future.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whom Rubio will meet Friday, has tried to adopt a middle line to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and insistence on transactional relations.

He said Europe also needs to “learn the language of power politics” to assert itself, for example, by taking greater responsibility for its security, striving for greater “technological independence” and boosting its economic growth. But he stressed that “as democracies, we are partners and allies and not subordinates” of the U.S.

Some, like French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, appear to have all but given up on Trump and the United States. Both Canada and France opened consulates in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, last week in a show of support for both Greenland and Denmark.

Macron warned this week that tensions between Europe and the U.S. could intensify after the recent “Greenland moment.” He described the Trump administration as “openly anti-European” and seeking the European Union’s “dismemberment."

“When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” he said in an interview with several European newspapers. “I think we’ve tried that strategy for months. It’s not working.”

Macron noted a “double crisis: We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side.”

Carney — who drew applause from many for pushing back against Trump in a speech last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland — has made no secret of his frustration and impatience with the Republican president.

Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. He vowed to pursue trade deals with countries other than the U.S., including China, to serve as anchors of commercial stability. The China deal drew new threats from Trump.

For many in Europe, Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland exacerbate their fears over Russia’s war with Ukraine and serve as a reminder of centuries of power politics in which diplomacy was subordinate to the use of military force.

“Greenland is to Trump as, essentially, Ukraine is to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, although obviously without the devastating war at this stage,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term in office.

In the meantime, as Trump tries to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and seek a nuclear deal with Iran, Europeans are increasingly uneasy about Trump’s “Board of Peace,” a 27-member group of world leaders tasked first with handling the Gaza peace agreement but eventually envisaged as a vehicle for resolving other major conflicts.

Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden, among others, have either declined to accept or have not yet signed on to the board, which will hold its first meeting to raise money for Gaza in Washington on Feb. 19.

Text: Iran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.

This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.

The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.

Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.

Trump said the strikes had "obliterated" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials "were thinking about starting a new site".

Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.

A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.

A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.

At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.

Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.

ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.

"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment," they said.

Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.

At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal.

Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would "help dampen" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside.

Also at Isfahan nuclear site, a new roof has been constructed. The building, attacked in an Israeli strike last year, is thought have been used in the manufacture of centrifuges.

Above-ground work is also visible at Natanz nuclear facility at a location damaged in air strikes by both Israel and the US last June. Between early December and January a roof has been built over a damaged anti-drone cage at an enrichment plant.

ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.

Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is "operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can".

"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed," he added. "Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything."

Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.

"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment," he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.

He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.

A potential restructure would affect sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield, a union says.

The expiration of New START means there are no limits on nuclear weapons between both countries for the first time since 1991.

Channels of communication were suspended in 2021 shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.


Tehran says its armed forces are ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression.
