Reporting from Caracas, Venezuela

In one corner of Venezuela’s capital, hundreds of government supporters held guns to their chests, as one speaker after another, microphone in hand, urged them to defend the nation with their lives.

In another corner, businessmen and diplomats worried about the escalating tensions between Venezuela and the United States, about what they see as a lost opportunity for dialogue between the two countries and about the possibility of a U.S. strike that could unleash bloodshed and chaos.

Still, in other parts of the capital, Caracas, there was a battle-weary calm and skepticism that there will ever be political change in Venezuela.

Granted a rare visa for foreign journalists, I spent a week in Venezuela at a particularly tense time. Relations with the United States are at a crossroads, with the Trump administration sending warships into the Caribbean. The buildup’s size and President Trump’s public threats against President Nicolás Maduro have raised the specter of strikes, of commando raids in the South American nation, or of some broader conflict.

President Trump has said he wants to unleash the military on cartels and stop trafficking to the United States, and his administration has called Mr. Maduro the head of a terrorist organization threatening the United States and flooding it with drugs.

The United States says it has blown up at least three drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, including at least two from Venezuela, in a significant escalation of the kind of pressure that Mr. Trump has put on Mexico to crack down on fentanyl.

But while some drugs do come from Venezuela, fentanyl does not, and the cocaine that does is a very small percentage of the trade, far less than what comes from Colombia and exits from Colombia and Ecuador, according to the U.S. government’s accounting.

That has led many observers to say that the Trump administration’s real goal is to go after Mr. Maduro.

In interviews, some Venezuelans said they supported any action that would lead to the ouster of Mr. Maduro, who is accused of major human rights violations and whose movement has led the country for a generation.

The group supporting the use of force is led by Maria Corina Machado, an opposition leader. Her base says that by removing Mr. Maduro, the United States could defend the result of last year’s presidential vote, which Mr. Maduro is widely believed to have lost. Independent vote monitors and many countries, including the United States, recognized Mr. Maduro’s opponent, Edmundo González, a surrogate for Ms. Machado, as the legitimate victor.

One of Ms. Machado’s advisers, Pedro Urruchurtu, said she was coordinating with the Trump administration and had a plan for the first 100 hours after Mr. Maduro’s fall. That plan involves the participation of international allies, he said, “especially the United States,” and would “guarantee a stable transition” to Mr. González.

But in interviews, other Venezuelans were far less eager to see the United States get involved. Many, even those who said they wanted to see Mr. Maduro gone, arguing that he has held on only through repression, said that a violent U.S. move was not the solution. Many people spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.

Some said they doubted the willingness of the United States to keep a large contingent of troops on the ground to ensure the stability of a U.S.-backed government.

Three diplomats said they saw few signs that anyone in Mr. Maduro’s inner circle would split to support an opposition leader, or that the military would turn on him.

Other Venezuelans warned that ousting Mr. Maduro would only invite the armed actors left behind — the military, Colombian guerrilla groups, paramilitary gangs — into a battle for the spoils.

And in Venezuela, with its oil, gold and other minerals, there are many spoils.

“You kill Maduro,” said one prominent businessman, “you turn Venezuela into Haiti,” which descended into chaos after its last president was assassinated.

Still others were skeptical that Mr. Trump was willing to get involved militarily and said that the president’s gunboat strategy, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would only push Venezuela further from the United States and toward China, Russia and Iran.

Mr. Maduro has responded to Washington’s mobilization by arming civilians, sending tanks into the streets and announcing military exercises throughout the country, which have been publicized on state television and social media. But his advisers say the central message to Washington is that their government does not want war.

The Venezuelan president sent a letter to Mr. Trump this month praising his efforts to halt other conflicts and said he was open to a “direct and frank conversation” with Mr. Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela, Richard Grenell.

Early this year, Mr. Grenell seemed to be trying to improve relations, traveling to Venezuela to meet with Mr. Maduro just after Mr. Trump took office. But more recently, Mr. Trump appears to favor Mr. Rubio’s hard-line approach.

In an interview at her office inside the country’s oil ministry building, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said that she believed Mr. Trump was leading the world into “a stage where the United States has openly declared war on the world.”

“The Ministry of Defense is no longer Defense, it’s the Ministry of War,” she said. “Trade relations are no longer trade relations, they are a trade war.”

She called the boat attacks “absolutely illegal” and called for a normalization of economic relations with the United States, which has imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s vital oil industry.

“The people of the United States do not want war in the Caribbean,” she said.

Even amid escalating tensions, Venezuela has continued to accept twice-weekly flights of deportees from the United States, said the country’s foreign minister, Yván Gil.

Several diplomats and business leaders in Caracas said that they hoped the United States would shift back to a policy of diplomacy, believing that persistent negotiations could eventually persuade Mr. Maduro to hand power to a reformist successor or moderate opposition leader in exchange for sanctions relief and other conditions.

They also said that he is tired but cannot leave office if he thinks he will be arrested. Mr. Maduro, who is 62 and has led the country since 2013, is under indictment in the United States on drug conspiracy charges.

On the streets of Caracas, the strain between the two nations has produced contrasting images of war and peace.

On a recent day, a downtown boulevard filled with people the government had gathered for a rally: some civilians, others members of the Bolivarian militia, a reserve force.

Several people said that they worked for the government, that their superiors had required attendance and that they had been given unloaded guns to hold during the event. Many hurried to leave as soon as it ended.

Others said that patriotism had brought them out and vowed to defend Mr. Maduro and his movement.

“If there is an invasion,” said Marisol Amundaray, 50, “I will safeguard my children and head to the street with my rifle.”

In other parts of the city, though, normal life continued. Not far from the presidential palace one morning, Constanza Sofía Arangeren twirled on a cobblestone street in a gold ball gown as a photographer snapped away.

She was preparing her 15th birthday celebration, and her mother was more anxious about the coming party than a possible invasion.

No one interviewed said they were hoarding supplies. Some said they were not worried about an attack; others said they couldn’t afford to.

“In a normal country where there is a threat like this, the first thing people do is stock up on food,” said Estefanie Mendoza, 42, a social worker with two children, “but we can’t do that.”

While the country’s economy has recovered somewhat since a protracted crisis helped fuel a migrant exodus, the rebound has been uneven.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have argued that significant amounts of cocaine are trafficked through Venezuela and that they are seeking to stop U.S. overdoses. A 2020 report from the U.S. State Department said just 10 percent to 13 percent of the global cocaine supply goes through Venezuela.

Fentanyl, which causes far more overdoses than cocaine, is almost entirely produced in Mexico with chemicals imported from China, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The boats that U.S. forces have bombed in the Caribbean have killed at least 17 people, according to the Trump administration.

Some legal experts have called it a crime to summarily kill civilians not directly taking part in hostilities, even if they are believed to be smuggling drugs.

In the state of Sucre, on Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, the first boat to have been destroyed, on Sept. 2, is widely believed to have been carrying people from the towns of San Juan de Unare and Güiria, on a spit of land known as the Paria Peninsula.

For years the region has been dominated by cocaine trafficking, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan journalist who has conducted field work in the area.

But migrants, trafficking victims and government-subsidized Venezuelan gasoline — which can be sold at a higher price in Trinidad and Tobago, just six miles away — also leave from this area, she said.

In an interview, one woman who identified herself as the wife of one of the dead men said that her husband was a fisherman with four children who left one day for work and never came back.

Some in Venezuela said they feared U.S. military action would mean more loss. And they said they didn’t believe that Ms. Machado, who says she is in hiding in Venezuela, and Mr. González, in exile in Spain, could guarantee their security.

“Name one successful case in the last few years of a successful U.S. military intervention,” said Henrique Capriles, an opposition politician who has clashed with Ms. Machado.

A bloodless U.S. “extraction” of Mr. Maduro was the stuff of Netflix, he said, not reality.

“And the cost for us Venezuelans, what will it be? What guarantee do we have that this will translate into a recovery of our democracy?”

Text: WASHINGTON, October 3. /TASS/. US troops stationed in Puerto Rico are ready to launch an operation to seize territory in Venezuela as part of the fight against drug trafficking and amid accusations by US President Donald Trump of ineffective counteraction against drug cartels, the Washington Examiner newspaper reported, citing military analysts.

Experts say that the forces assembled are now sufficient to capture and hold key strategic targets, such as ports and airfields in Venezuela. The newspaper emphasized that the Pentagon is not particularly hiding its preparations for these potential operations. The Washington Examiner noted that, according to a report from the US War Department in late August, drills off the coast of the Virgin Islands included a landing operation and the seizure of an airfield.

Earlier, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto strongly protested the intrusion of US warplanes into the country’s airspace. The top diplomat called such actions a provocation that threatens national sovereignty and violates international law.

On September 5, Trump assured that Washington was not considering overthrowing the government in Caracas. On September 2, he reported that the US armed forces had killed 11 members of a Venezuelan drug cartel during an operation in international waters. According to Trump, Venezuela is not doing enough to combat drug trafficking. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro expressed the opinion that the country is facing its most serious threat of US invasion in 100 years.

Text: WASHINGTON, October 3. /TASS/. The administration of US President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to commence operations against alleged Venezuelan drug cartels, recognized as terrorist organizations in the United States under the laws of armed conflict, The Hill reported, citing a document.

"The President directed the Department of War to conduct operations against them [cartels] pursuant to the law of armed conflict," reads the notice sent to US Congress. It also states that the US is now engaged in "a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations." The notice further declares that the US "has now reached a critical point," where it "must use force in self-defense and defense of others."

According to the newspaper, the document does not specify which drug cartels classified as terrorist organizations will be targeted by the US military. The Pentagon has also not provided a list of cartel names.

Earlier, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto strongly protested the intrusion of US combat aircraft into the republic's airspace, as recorded by Venezuela's integrated air defense system. He called these actions a provocation that threatens national sovereignty and violates international law.

On September 5, Trump assured that Washington was not considering overthrowing the government in Caracas. Just days earlier, on September 2, he reported that US forces had killed 11 members of a Venezuelan drug cartel during an operation in international waters. According to Trump, Venezuela is not doing enough to combat drug trafficking.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has voiced the opinion that the republic is facing the most serious threat of a US invasion in the last 100 years.

Venezuela’s Defence Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on Oct 2 that five combat planes had been detected near the country’s coast, in what he characterised as a threat by the United States.

“They are imperialist combat planes that have dared to come close to the Venezuelan coast,” Mr Padrino said from an air base, in comments broadcast on state television, adding information about the planes had been reported to a control tower by an airline.

“The presence of these planes flying close to our Caribbean Sea is a vulgarity, a provocation, a threat to the security of the nation,” Mr Padrino added.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a later statement, the government said Colombian flag-carrier Avianca reported the planes approximately 75km from the Venezuelan coast.

Avianca did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Venezuela “urges US Secretary of War Peter Hegseth to immediately cease his reckless, thrill-seeking and warmongering posture,” which is disturbing the peace of the Caribbean, the statement added.

The US has deployed a fleet of warships through the Caribbean in an operation Washington says is combating drug trafficking. The US has also struck several boats it claims were carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing those aboard.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has alleged the US is seeking regime change, but has also offered to engage in talks with US envoy Richard Grenell.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has played down suggestions of regime change, but has repeatedly accused Mr Maduro of leading drug trafficking networks, which the Venezuelan president denies. REUTERS

Text: There is a very real fear of regime change in Venezuela.

Over the past week, the buildup of the United States’ naval assets in the Caribbean has ballooned to include seven destroyers, multiple amphibious landing craft, and one nuclear-powered attack submarine, Reuters reported.

Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said on Friday (September 26) that the military buildup was to “combat and dismantle drug trafficking organisations, criminal cartels and…foreign terrorist organisations in our hemisphere”.

But experts say that the White House’s reasoning does not pass muster, and the deployment represents a gross “operational overkill”.

After all, much of the seaborne drug trade travels stateside via the Pacific, and much of what passes through the Caribbean is flown in. “The massive naval flotilla off the coast of Venezuela…has little to do with actual drug interdiction — they represent operational overkill,” Adm. James G Stavridis (retd), a former head of the Pentagon’s Southern Command, told The New York Times.

Experts and Venezuelan officials believe that Donald Trump’s real motives are to force Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro out of power, by hook or by crook.

“I think what they are trying to do is put maximum pressure…on the regime to see if they can get it to break…It’s gunboat diplomacy,” David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University, told Reuters.

A chequered history

The United States has a long history of meddling in the affairs of Latin American countries (and elsewhere), one which has seen Washington rig elections, facilitate coups, and undermine democratic processes, all to install acquiescent regimes in strategically important countries.

“Throughout the twentieth century and into the beginning of the twenty-first, the United States repeatedly used its military power, and that of its clandestine services, to overthrow governments that refused to protect American interests,” wrote author Stephen Kinzer in his book Overthrow: America’s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq (2006).

“Each time, it cloaked its intervention in the rhetoric of national security and liberation. In most cases, however, it acted mainly for economic reasons — specifically, to establish, promote, and defend the right of Americans to do business around the world without interference,” Kinzer wrote.

Interventions in Latin America have been borne out of the Monroe Doctrine, a foreign policy position first articulated by President James Monroe in 1823, which holds the New World as the United States’ zone of influence. Post-1945, these were also in line with the Truman Doctrine of containment: the Cold War-era US foreign policy geared at arresting the spread of communism.

Over the years, the US has installed (or tried to) friendly regimes in a dozen Latin American countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela.

Even if history alone was not enough to justify Caracas’ fears of regime change, Trump’s actions, in this term and his previous one, have not left much to imagination.

In January 2019, Trump had officially declared pro-Washington opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela President, and handed over the control of Venezuela’s bank accounts and property in the US to him. This came after Washington imposed sanctions on the sale of oil to the US, a major source of income for Venezuela.

Maduro’s personal assets were also frozen, and he was effectively barred from leaving his country. Notably, in 2017-18, ahead of the 2018 presidential polls in Venezuela, the Trump administration had held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela to discuss plans for a coup to overthrow Maduro.

The NYT, in 2019, had described Trump’s actions as “one of Washington’s most overt attempts in decades to carry out regime change in Latin America”.

Soon after returning to power in January 2025, Trump resumed his attacks on Venezuela, this time under the guise of going after drug cartels. Notably, the White House has repeatedly called Maduro a cartel leader and a “fugitive of American justice”.

Draft legislation is circulating at the White House and on Capitol Hill that would give Trump broad powers to wage war against drug cartels he deems to be “terrorists,” as well as against any country he says has harboured or helped them, The NYT reported.

Unlike previous American interventions, Trump has not used esoteric ideas such as “exporting democracy” or “liberating the country” to justify his actions.

For Trump, “It is a national security initiative meant to eliminate a source of tons of cocaine from entering the United States,” José Cárdenas, a former National Security Council and US State Department official who has dealt extensively with Latin America policy, told Newsweek. “Main Street, USA, can identify with that,” he added.

That said, there is more to it.

Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Since 1999, when anti-Washington socialist Hugo Chávez was voted to power in Venezuela, the US has long struggled to exert greater control over the country’s oil reserves. This is what prompted the US to back an eventually unsuccessful coup against Chávez in 2002, and continues to be the bedrock of American interests in Venezuela today.

Tom Shannon, a career diplomat who served as undersecretary for political affairs during the first Trump administration, told Newsweek: “Venezuela is sitting on the largest reserves of oil and gas in the world, and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control), through its licensing process, gets to control who works in the oil and gas sector”.

The belief in the US establishment is that if US companies were given licenses to operate in Venezuela, foreign competitors from nations viewed as hostile to US interests — such as China or Russia — would be expelled.

This is why international support for Maduro, a protege of Chávez, has largely been on geopolitical lines. After the US sanctions in 2019, China has emerged the largest importer of Venezuela’s oil.

After taking office in January, Trump sent special envoy Richard Grenell to strike a deal in Caracas to secure a license for oil giant Chevron to resume operations in the country, among other things.

Maduro is not a popular leader. Decades of economic mismanagement, corruption, and allegations of human rights violations have taken a toll on his and his party’s image. Many independent watchdogs agree that Maduro lost the 2024 elections, but held onto power with the help of massive rigging.

Many in Venezuela want Maduro gone. Others, including those who disagree with Maduro’s politics, are skeptical of what such an ouster would mean for the country.

For one, given the history of US misadventures in Latin America and the violence it has often unleashed, many are staunchly opposed to any American intervention. Others fear that the US would not do enough to ensure stability in the country; they say that simply removing Maduro while not working toward broader reform would unleash a catastrophic political crisis.

As one opposition politician told The NYT, ““And the cost for us Venezuelans, what will it be? What guarantee do we have that this (removal of Maduro) will translate into a recovery of our democracy?”

In December 2024, a woman was found dead in a sugarcane field in Maharashtra, sparking public outrage over the human-wildlife conflict. The initial statement of a leopard attack was later revealed to be a planned murder by the victim's husband's nephew and a laborer. They were arrested and a charge sheet was filed against them.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro stands up at the end of a press conference, days after he said Venezuela would deploy military, police and civilian defenses at 284 \"battlefront\" locations across the country, amid heightened tensions with the U.S., in Caracas, Venezuela, September 15, 2025.

CARACAS - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has signed a decree granting him additional security powers in case the U.S. military enters the country, the nation's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, said on Monday.

The measure marks the latest escalation in tensions between the two countries, with Maduro publicly alleging that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is plotting to oust him.

The decree would allow Maduro to mobilize armed forces throughout the country and give the military authority over public services and the oil industry.

The U.S. has deployed a fleet of warships through the Caribbean, which Washington says is to combat drug trafficking through the region.

In recent weeks, the U.S. has also struck several boats it claims were carrying illicit drugs from Venezuela, killing those aboard. Experts have questioned the legality of the strikes.

Privately, Maduro has sought to reconcile with Trump, sending a letter to his counterpart earlier this month offering to engage in direct talks.

Maduro rejected U.S. claims that Venezuela played a big role in drug trafficking, and told Trump he wanted the relationship between the two countries to be "historic and peaceful."

Still, U.S. military officials are drawing up plans to strike alleged targets related to drug trafficking within Venezuela, NBC News reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

"What the U.S. government, what warlord Marco Rubio is doing against Venezuela is a threat," Rodriguez told diplomats in a meeting on Monday.

Venezuela's military has carried out training exercises with volunteer militia members in recent days, with soldiers teaching members of the public to handle weapons in preparation for what leaders call a possible U.S. incursion.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The powers granted under the decree signed by Maduro would be valid for a 90-day period, with the option to be renewed for a further 90 days, according to the nation's constitution. REUTERS

Text: UNITED NATIONS, September 27. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed Moscow’s concern over Washington’s activities in and around Venezuela’s territorial waters, he said at a press conference following Russia’s participation in the High-Level Week of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly.

"We are, without a doubt, very worried that the Americans are now operating in what are still international waters, but surrounding Venezuela’s territorial waters," the minister said.

Lavrov also referenced his meetings in recent days with colleagues from Latin America and the Caribbean, noting that they are all "extremely concerned."

"Earlier this morning, on President [of the US Donald] Trump's orders, I directed a lethal, kinetic strike on a narco-trafficking vessel affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations," he wrote on his X page. "The strike was conducted in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela while the vessel was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics - headed to America to poison our people."

According to Hegseth, four men aboard the vessel, identified as narco-terrorists by the US intelligence, were killed in the strike.

"These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over," he emphasized.

"We appreciate support of the [UN] Secretary General. He confirmed that he considers the military threat from the US side in the Caribbean Basin as unjustified and unacceptable because it violates the UN Charter and jeopardizes stability and sovereignty of the entire region," the minister said on the Telegram channel.

During the meeting, "sovereignty and peace were confirmed in Venezuela - the country that is free from planting illegal crops and has no relation to the international drugs turnover," he added.

Mr Donald Trump said on Oct 2 his administration is considering attacking drug cartels “coming by land” in Venezuela.

Published Oct 03, 2025, 05:25 AM

Updated Oct 03, 2025, 06:53 AM

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, according to a document notifying Congress of its legal justification for deadly US strikes on boats off Venezuela.

The text of the document, which was reviewed by Reuters on Oct 2, was briefed to lawmakers by the Pentagon’s top attorney this week as experts question the legality of killing suspected drug traffickers at sea instead of apprehending them and their cargo.

The US military has blown up at least three suspected drug boats in the past month and killed at least 17 people, in what critics say is the latest effort by Mr Trump to test the scope of his powers as US president. The document describes those killed as “unlawful combatants”.

The document did not appear to provide any new legal rationale other than what Mr Trump and his allies have said publicly, arguments that some former military lawyers say fail to satisfy requirements under the law of war.

It was not clear if the determination was intended to provide a justification for future military strikes on cartels, or if it was mainly to explain past actions.

Mr Trump said on Oct 2 his administration is considering attacking drug cartels “coming by land” in Venezuela, actions that could raise further legal questions.

The document said Mr Trump had determined that drug cartels were effectively non-state armed groups whose actions “constitute an armed attack against the United States”.

“The President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organisations,” according to the text of the document.

“The President directed the Department of War to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict,” it said, using the Republican president’s preferred name for the Defense Department.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Legal experts have questioned why the US military is carrying out the strikes instead of the Coast Guard, which is the main US maritime law enforcement agency, and why other efforts to halt the shipments aren’t made before resorting to deadly strikes.

“Applying a new label to an old problem does not transform the problem itself – nor does it grant the US president or the US military expanded legal authority to kill civilians,” wrote Mr Mark Nevitt, a former Navy lawyer who is now an associate professor at Emory University School of Law.

The Trump administration has argued so far that the strikes send a clear message to the drug cartels and noted that it designated them terrorist organisations earlier this year.

Addressing a gathering of senior generals and admirals this week in Quantico, Virginia, Mr Trump defended the strikes by saying each boat has enough narcotics to kill 25,000 people.

He also said the strategy was stemming the flow of seaborn drugs through the Caribbean.

“Now we have a problem. General Caine says, sir, there are no boats out there, not even fishing boats. They don’t want to go fishing,” Mr Trump said, referring to General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“I don’t blame them. There’ll be no fishing today, you know. But it’s amazing what strength will do,” Mr Trump said.

US Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the Trump administration has failed to provide Congress with any credible justification or intelligence to justify its actions.

“Every American should be alarmed that their president has decided he can wage secret wars against anyone he calls an enemy,” Mr Reed said in a statement. REUTERS

In this first edition of The World newsletter, we explore why a president who campaigned against “foreign wars” is sending warships to Venezuela.

I am the host of The World.

President Trump’s plans for Venezuela have been a slow-building mystery, but the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, is feeling the heat.

The U.S. military has deployed warships, surveillance planes and an attack submarine to the Caribbean. It has attacked boats from Venezuela that it has claimed, without evidence, were smuggling drugs, killing 17 people. The administration calls Maduro a cartel leader and a “fugitive of American justice.” Some current and former U.S. officials contend that the unstated goal is to force him from power.

In other words, regime change.

It sounds like the kind of foreign conflict Trump once campaigned against. But my colleague Julie Turkewitz, who just spent a week in Venezuela and has years of experience reporting on the region, told me that Trump might not be thinking about the country in those terms. (You can watch our full conversation here.)

The question that could determine Maduro’s fate is whether the Trump administration sees a regime change effort in Venezuela as the kind of “foreign war” the president has pledged to avoid, or as an operation to protect America’s interests in its own backyard.

‘You turn Venezuela into Haiti’

There are plenty of Venezuelans who would be happy to see Maduro go. He has been accused of major human rights violations, including torture and forced disappearances. He lost the 2024 election, according to independent vote monitors, and held onto power anyway. In recent weeks, one of Venezuela’s opposition leaders, María Corina Machado, has said she would welcome the U.S. military’s help to remove him from office.

But during Julie’s time in Venezuela, she spoke to many people who didn’t feel the same way. In a part of the world where the U.S. has a long history of military intervention and support for dictatorships, there is a visceral rejection of the idea of American-imposed change.

Local diplomats and business leaders warn that military action could unleash bloodshed and chaos. If the government collapsed, armed actors in the region — including the military, Colombian guerrilla groups and paramilitary gangs — could join a battle for the spoils. And in Venezuela, with its oil, gold and other minerals, there are many spoils, Julie points out.

“You kill Maduro,” one businessman told her, “you turn Venezuela into Haiti.”

After long-running wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the combination of the words America and regime change raises alarm bells, both inside and outside the U.S. Venezuela’s government may be trying to leverage that. The country’s vice president told Julie that the American people “do not want war in the Caribbean.”

Sphere of influence?

As a presidential candidate, Trump promised not to involve the U.S. in foreign wars.

But he also campaigned on deporting undocumented immigrants back to Latin America and on fighting drug smuggling. And he made inroads among Hispanic voters who strongly opposed socialist governments like those in Venezuela and its ally, Cuba.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been pushing for regime change in Venezuela. “We’re not going to have a cartel, operating or masquerading as a government, operating in our own hemisphere,” he told Fox News.

This focus on America’s “own hemisphere” suggests that administration officials think of Venezuela differently than, say, Ukraine or Iraq, Julie told me. They might see it as a country that plays a direct role in the issues they care most about, in a location that’s close to home — a country in America’s sphere of influence.

The military buildup off the coast of Venezuela, while striking, is just one example of the Trump administration’s interventionist approach to Latin America. It has threatened to take over the Panama Canal and to bomb Mexican drug labs. It has thrown itself into Brazilian domestic politics on behalf of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Last week, it offered a $20 billion loan to prop up the political fortunes of President Javier Milei of Argentina.

Some of this seems to be driven by ideological affinities: Trump sees Bolsonaro and Milei as allies, and Maduro as an enemy. But an aggressive focus on America’s backyard may soon be official U.S. doctrine. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly preparing to release a new national defense strategy. It prioritizes “protecting the homeland and the Western Hemisphere.”

Moldova’s pro-Europe party is poised to win a parliamentary election that has been framed as a showdown between Europe and Russia. Though Moldova is a tiny nation, this election is being closely watched: The former Soviet republic, which is wedged between Romania and Ukraine, is strategically important because of the war in Ukraine.

Russia tried to sway the election by pouring millions into buying off voters and staging a disinformation effort, the pro-Europe party said. As voters headed to the polls yesterday, the Moldovan government reported cyberattacks on electoral systems and hoax bomb threats at voting sites.

The projected win, which still needs to be made official after the final votes are counted, could advance the country’s push to enter the European Union.

The indictment of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, comes as the Trump administration has ramped up legal action to humiliate, investigate and prosecute the president’s enemies. (Here’s what to know.)

Fashion Week is back in Kyiv. But fashion, like everything else in Ukraine, has been marked by the war.

Some designers highlighted models who were missing limbs. In a country with many injured soldiers and civilians, it makes sense to create adaptive outfits with zippers, snaps, Velcro and rubber waistlines. “It sends out a big message,” said Dmytro Tereshchenko, 21, a former soldier who started modeling after losing his leg.

A hip-shaking, hair-flipping Turkish girl group called Manifest sings silly songs about love and romances gone bad. In April, the band released a catchy single called “Ariyo” — and things started getting a little more serious.

Fans quickly realized that the song’s chorus fit well with the anti-government protest chant “Hak! Hukuk! Adalet!” (“Rights! Law! Justice!”), a refrain heard during mass demonstrations this year against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government. Soon, audiences at the group’s concerts were chanting along.

The government began an investigation into Manifest for public indecency. An adviser to Erdogan called the band members “immoral, indecent, shameless creatures.” Judges barred them from leaving the country, and blocked access to some of their concert videos.

Under pressure, Manifest has canceled its countrywide tour, but the group doesn’t appear to be discouraged: It has new music coming soon.

Onigiri are portable snacks often sold in Japanese convenience stores. They are made of rice, usually stuffed with salty, tangy fillings and then wrapped in seaweed. When grilled, glazed or cooked, they become yaki onigiri.

In this version, a little bit of pickled shiitake filling goes a long way.
