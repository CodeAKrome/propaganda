<text>We bring you a comprehensive look at the escalating tensions and complex developments surrounding the Gaza ceasefire, a truce now facing significant strains and accusations of manipulation.</text>

<text>Our lead story tonight focuses on the profound fragility of the current ceasefire and the deeply concerning issue of the remaining Israeli hostages.</text>

<text>Despite a US-brokered agreement, Hamas has consistently been accused of failing to fulfill its obligations, particularly regarding the return of the remains of 13 deceased captives.</text>

<text>Families of these hostages are voicing desperate pleas, demanding a halt to further phases of the ceasefire deal until all bodies are returned, expressing a profound fear that Hamas knows exactly where these individuals are held and is deliberately stalling.</text>

<text>Adding to these anxieties are accusations that Hamas is engaged in calculated deception.</text>

<text>Israeli military reservists claim to have witnessed Hamas operatives staging the discovery of a deceased hostage's body, attempting to create a false impression of compliance.</text>

<text>These accounts, allegedly supported by drone footage, suggest a deliberate manipulation of the narrative surrounding the ceasefire.</text>

<text>This alleged deceit underscores a broader theme: the perception that Hamas views the ceasefire not as a path to peace, but as a temporary pause, or 'hudna', to regroup, rearm, and cement its control over Gaza.</text>

<text>Indeed, reports suggest Hamas is already leveraging this time to reorganize its command structures, rebuild tunnels, and smuggle in new weapons, effectively regaining strength.</text>

<text>This situation casts a critical light on the Trump administration's "peace plan."</text>

<text>The deal, forged with Qatar and Turkey, has drawn significant criticism for allegedly forcing Israel to relinquish military advantages and release thousands of Arab militants, including Yahya Sinwar, identified as a mastermind of the October 7th attacks.</text>

<text>Critics argue that Phase Two of this plan, which calls for Hamas's disarmament and the establishment of an international stabilization force, is fundamentally unrealistic.</text>

<text>They point to Hamas's deep-seated commitment to its arsenal as an instrument of power, dissent suppression, and leader dominance, making voluntary disarmament tantamount to political suicide for the group.</text>

<text>The historical record of peacekeeping missions also suggests that such forces struggle when faced with irreconcilable adversaries, often becoming ineffective or withdrawing.</text>

<text>Hamas's tactics continue to reveal a pattern of behavior deeply concerning to many.</text>
<entities><org>Hamas</org></entities>

<text>Beyond the alleged ceasefire violations and deceptive practices, reports indicate the group continues to behave as Gaza's undisputed ruler, eliminating rivals, controlling aid distribution, and even using civilian structures like mosques as military headquarters, stocked with explosives and RPG ammunition.</text>

<text>This persistent use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes highlights the complex and often brutal reality on the ground.</text>

<text>In response to these provocations, Israel is grappling with its next steps.</text>

<text>Defence Minister Israel Katz has ordered the military to take all necessary measures to eliminate terrorist threats in the West Bank, where violence has surged significantly since the October 7th Hamas attack.</text>

<text>More than 988 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since October 7th, while 43 Israelis have died in Palestinian attacks.</text>

<text>Politically, some Israeli factions, like Otzma Yehudit, are actively pushing for a renewed and intensified military offensive in Gaza, alongside calls for establishing Israeli settlement and sovereignty in the Strip, viewing this as essential for Israel's long-term security.</text>

<text>The prospect of an international stabilization force, a key component of the US peace plan, is also facing significant disputes.</text>

<text>While nations like Indonesia and Azerbaijan have expressed willingness to deploy troops, Israel has voiced strong opposition to Turkey's participation, citing Ankara's hostile policy, including diplomatic and economic measures, under President Erdogan.</text>

<text>Jordan's King Abdullah II, while open to training Palestinian security forces in cooperation with Egypt, has firmly stated that his country will not send troops to Gaza, reflecting a broader regional reluctance to become embroiled in internal policing of the enclave.</text>

<text>Concerns also persist regarding the role of Qatar as a mediator, particularly after revelations that a Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman previously voiced support for Palestinian suicide bombings and rocket attacks on Israeli civilian targets.</text>

<text>Reconstruction efforts, estimated to cost between 70 and 80 billion dollars, are stalled by ongoing disputes over who should oversee the monumental task.</text>

<text>This destruction also hampers the recovery of bodies, both Israeli and Palestinian, with potentially as many as 10,000 Palestinians unaccounted for and presumed dead.</text>
