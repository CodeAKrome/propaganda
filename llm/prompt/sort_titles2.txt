- Level 2: Geographic region or sector focus (e.g., Europe, Asia, Middle East, US Economy, Corporate, Energy, Technology)
- Level 3: Specific topic/event (e.g., Russia-Ukraine War, Elections, Immigration, Climate Change, Trade, Courts)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use EXACTLY three levels for every article
2. Be consistent in naming (e.g., always "Russia-Ukraine War" not "Ukraine Crisis")
3. Keep the original ID and title unchanged
