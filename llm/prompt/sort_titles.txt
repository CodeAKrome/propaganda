2. Put each title into a category

3. create 3 levels of categories

4. keep id and title together.
   
Data format: id, article title

This process involves parsing the provided data, creating a three-level categorical hierarchy for each news article, and then sorting the final list by these categories. The full, categorized list is provided below.

The three-level categorization used is:

1. **Level 1 (Broad Topic):** E.g., World, US Politics, Business/Economy.
    
2. **Level 2 (Geographic/Sector Focus):** E.g., Europe Politics, US Economy, Corporate News.
    
3. **Level 3 (Specific Subject/Event):** E.g., Immigration, UN Summit, Russia-Ukraine War.

The output is sorted alphabetically by Level 1, then Level 2, then Level 3, and finally by the article title.
