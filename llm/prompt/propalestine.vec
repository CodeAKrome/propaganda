Osama El Khatib, 26, was ordered held on $10,000 cash bail after prosecutors allege he assaulted police officers to help fellow agitators escape arrest.

Pro-Palestinian agitators accused of being behind a riot Tuesday are now being charged with "promotion of anarchy" after the melee left several officers injured.

The Boston Herald reported that the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office on Thursday upgraded charges for all 13 suspects, who are now accused of violating a state law that makes "promotion of anarchy" illegal and is a felony charge, according to court documents.

On Tuesday night, between 200 and 300 people participated in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in downtown Boston that quickly descended into a riot. Thirteen people were arrested after police allege they became violent toward law enforcement officers.

A spokesperson for the district attorney's office told the Herald the upgraded charges come after a Boston Police Department review of posters promoting the so-called protest, which feature a quote from a Hamas spokesperson and a burning police cruiser.

"Peace be upon your souls that will one day soar in the skies of your liberated Al Quid’s and Al Aqsa, purified from the defilement of your killers," the poster read, according to police.

Because of that, police determined there was probable cause that the group "intended to conduct their rally and march in such a way that it induced fear, caused destruction and disruption, caused injury and promoted anarchy."

Four police officers were injured during the riot.

"Further investigation revealed violent imagery and rhetoric used in promotional media for the Oct. 7 incident," the DA's spokesperson said. "This organizing material promoted violence against police and presented an immediate threat to public safety which, combined with the actions of the individuals arrested, provided clear justification for the enhanced charges."

Boston police said the group "surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts," adding that "several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face.

"As violence escalated," police said, more officers were sent to the area while the agitators "continued to resist dispersal."

Officers reported that the rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment.

"During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear," the agency said.

Police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and obstruction of emergency response efforts, along with a slew of other charges including assault.

Osama El Khatib, 26, Roder Atwood, 21, Atalanta Carrig-Braun, 20, Haley MacIntyre, 24, Madeline Weikel, 27, Jacob Pettigrew, 22, Amun Prophet, 25, Laith Hintzman, 19, Benjamin Choucroun, 20, Owen Woodcock, 26, Prahlad Iyengar, 25, Styx Hatch, 19, and Gabrielle Smith, 28, were arrested on Tuesday night.

Bail was set on Wednesday and Thursday for those arrested, ranging from $500 to $10,000.

Notably, bail for Atwood, El Khatib and Hatch was set at $10,000. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office alleges that Khatib punched police officers to help fellow suspects escape without being arrested. While the district attorney's office requested $5,000 cash bail, the judge set bail at $10,000.

The Boston Herald reported that Atwood allegedly broke a police officer's nose during an assault, according to prosecutors.

Suffolk County DA Kevin Hayden sent a message to future protesters in a statement on Wednesday: Remain peaceful or face prosecution.

"These defendants were not in court today because they were protesting," Hayden said. "They were in court because they committed crimes. If you assault police and commit other offenses, you’re going to be arrested and prosecuted, period.

"Peaceful protests happen all the time in this city," he said. "We support everyone’s right to protest. But these individuals chose against protesting peacefully, and they are now facing the consequences of those choices."

According to Boston.com, the initial protest was organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, which coincided with the two-year mark of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas.

The protest was intended to "flood downtown for Palestine."

According to the report, people yelled "F--- you, Nazis" and "BPD is KKK" as they refused to leave the area.

Title: The playbook for fighting antisemism in America, Part II
Published:

Text: Part I can be read here.

Atchalta, which provided the backing for this must-read essay, is a non-partisan Zionist leadership SWAT team that strives to be the gatekeeper of social cohesion and national resilience in Israel. Reposted with their permission.

Dor Lasker, Dr. Jael Eskenazi-Zilcha, and Dr. Carmit Padan are co-authors with Eran Shayshon.

Introduction: The Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza as a Hamas Strategy

In the years before October 7th, Hamas and Iranian spokespersons used "open war" (حرب مفتوحة) to describe their plan to collapse Israel. Given Israel's military superiority, the 'Muqawama axis' seeks a long war of attrition to break Israeli society's spirit and erode Israel's legitimacy to defend itself.[i]

Hamas positioned Gaza's humanitarian crisis as a campaign target to pressure Israel to stop the war. The October 7 attack was planned knowing the Israeli response would harm Palestinian civilians. Hamas built terrorist infrastructure in civilian areas and exploited population vulnerabilities to portray Israel as violating international law and spread genocide accusations.[ii]

The wave of antisemitism and Israel's international isolation results not just from Gaza imagery, but from an organized network campaign undermining Israel's legitimacy, promoted by Western organizations with involvement and funding from bodies sympathetic to the Islamist Muqawama axis.

When Gaza Meets 'Wokeism'

Antisemitism comes in many different shapes and forms: Antisemitism is a single name for various social phenomena based on hatred toward Jews, but differing in perpetrators, characteristics, and expressions.

The Pro-Hamas Strain of Antisemitism

In the US and other Western democracies, 'pro-Hamas antisemitism' erupted during the war, categorizing Jews as white and privileged. Progressive discourse's binary division into oppressors (whites) and oppressed served as the ideological platform for massive antisemitism after October 7. Some characteristics include:

Jews are attributed original sin for Israel, must dissociate from Zionism;

Jews are perceived as responsible for institutional racism and oppression;

-Identification with Hamas as a 'progressive' liberation movement;

-Minimizing or justifying harm to Jews and Israel;

-Denying Israel's legitimacy and Judaism's connection to the land;

-Accusing Jews of dual loyalty.

Islamism, the Red-Green Alliance, Qatar and Antisemitism

American Islamist organizations lead efforts undermining Israel's legitimacy. The global Muslim Brotherhood seeks a global caliphate with an antisemitic, anti-Western agenda emphasizing Sharia law and Muslim empowerment in Western countries. [i]

Despite dogmatic agendas, Muslim Brotherhood organizations show pragmatism, connecting with the Western left in a more decentralized manner than previously. [ii]

Islamist organizations underwent Americanization[iii] and progressivization, adopting progressive rhetoric to strengthen partnerships with the progressive movement and enable Muslim integration in the US. In the UK, Muslim Brotherhood organizations portrayed political Islam as addressing Salafi radicalism ('Lambertism doctrine'),[iv] generating increasing legitimacy for Muslim Brotherhood organizations across the West. [v]

Muslim Brotherhood movements succeed through adaptability,[vi] introducing agenda items into mainstream discourse,[vii] and becoming informal Muslim community representatives to Western authorities. [viii]

To promote their doctrine, Islamist bodies in all Western democracies work to create alliances with the radical left (known as the Red-Green Alliance), connecting Islamist elements with anti-Western, anti-Zionist left-wing factors. [ix]

The Red-Green Alliance became important in Europe decades ago, migrated to the US, [x] and spearheads efforts to undermine Israel's legitimacy through strong cooperation despite ideological differences. [xi]

Qatar supports the global Muslim Brotherhood and Red-Green Alliance, becoming the largest donor to American universities and penetrating elementary schools[xii] with antisemitic content, possibly connected to Critical Race Theory's influence. Qatar intensified US lobbying using Al Jazeera as its main soft power tool, promoting extreme ideology in Arabic and anti-Zionist content in English, despite ordered foreign agent registration.

Qatar maintains immunity through its "Major Non-NATO Ally" status for hosting America's largest Middle East base, allowing continued Hamas support despite threats to American interests. Thus, despite the current administration's aggressive activity against ‘DEI culture’ and antisemitism on campus, its silence in the face of Qatar's involvement is deafening.

The Progressive Infrastructure for Pro-Hamas Antisemitism

The Change in the Western Left's Approach to Israel: From Kibbutz to Kibbush (Occupation). The Western left showed great sympathy for Israel until 1967, but gradually changed from viewing Israel as victim to executioner. [xiii] The radical left completely reversed its view 'from kibbutz to Kibbush', seeing Israel transform from a progressive socialist model to representing Western evils.

Identity Politics and the Rise of Critical Race Theory: [xiv] Beginning mid-last decade, a theory assuming American liberalism is historically racist and institutional racism is common penetrated US minority struggles and identity politics discourse.

One branch of Critical Race Theory is intersectionality, [xv] emphasizing overlap between discrimination forms rooted in white male racist establishment. This became an organizing idea creating minority coalitions against the 'white establishment', influencing mainstream discourse globally through oppressor-oppressed rankings based on socio-economic status and skin color.

Since the Ferguson riots during Operation Protective Edge (2014), anti-Israel organizations became integral to the intersectionality coalition. Some, especially among African-American and LGBTQ communities, support BDS by applying uniform moral codes globally and interpreting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through American anti-racism concepts.

The categorization of Jews as white creates an 'erasure' of Israel and American Jewry in the public sphere. Progressive discourse labeling Jews as white attributes responsibility for white oppression to them, creating a mismatch between current progressive discourse and the Jewish experience of historical suffering in the US.

The categorization of Jews as white enables Western antisemitism and Israel's branding as colonial. When Jews are considered white and privileged, antisemitism becomes a 'problem of the rich' with no urgency, while Israel appears as a white colonial state. Unlike traditional antisemitism, this discrimination isn't always intentional or hatred-fueled, and propagators aren't necessarily antisemites.

Progressive discourse in its current form poses a challenge to Israel's national security by undermining Israel-US relations, Jewish standing in the American left, and Israel's bipartisan political support.

The Combination of 'Wokeism' and Islamism Poses a Challenge to America (and Liberal Democracies in the West)

Islamism currently hides behind progressive discourse. Islamist organizations spread ideology within US Muslim communities while externally adopting progressive discourse and joining intersectionality coalitions. This restrained strategy, called 'civilizational Jihad process',[i] uses progressive discourse as means to eliminate Western civilization from within.

As progressive groups' influence grows, their radical agenda challenges Western liberal democracies' fabric. Principles of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) transformed from tools compensating market failure to goals achieved at any cost, creating organizational cultures in workplaces, educational institutions, public organizations, and private companies, which undermine basic Western democratic values, for example:

Chronic anti-patriotism and undermining the social fabric: Dogmatic DEI content portrays the US as inherently racist,[ii] creating alienation between young Americans and their country, possibly explaining youth equanimity toward flag burnings after October 7. This creates cultural coercion forcing adoption of certain language at freedom's expense.

Undermining meritocracy in universities and private sector. DEI politicized institutions, with Israeli academics suffering silent boycotts regardless of achievements. The Islamism-progressive fusion pressures corporations to stop Israeli connections despite economic justification.

Promoting chaos and undermining social and governmental structure. Some progressive movements call for demolishing government institutions they perceive as fundamentally racist rather than reform, creating calls to Defund the Police without alternatives for maintaining public order.

Outright denial of basic scientific criteria. Professor Alan Sokal[iii] argues ideology threatens science, citing Nature magazine's decision to subject articles to ideological judgment, potentially rejecting scientifically correct research that might subjectively harm certain groups' dignity.

The Influence of the Red-Green Alliance on Internal Discourse and Foreign Policy: The Red-Green Alliance influences American foreign policy through Muslim Brotherhood lobbies, progressive congresspeople, Qatari and Turkish support, and Al Jazeera coverage, creating coordinated global pressure to undermine Israel's legitimacy.[iv]

Certain progressive groups join elements undermining American hegemony. These groups receive backing from China, Russia, and Iran's coalition challenging the post-WWII order. Progressive groups' motivation aligns with the global anti-American agenda, creating cooperation seeking to bring down America, exemplified by Iran's Supreme Leader praising anti-Israel campus protesters.[v]

The conclusion is that the current pro-Hamas antisemitism is a symptom of 'wokeism' threatening America and Western liberal democracies. Progressive discourse incorporates Islamist principles, undermines pluralistic education and democracy, promotes division, abolishes meritocracy, and joins anti-American states seeking to dismantle America.

The October 8th ‘Conceptsia’ of US Jewry

The Jewish world experienced fundamental surprise regarding pro-Hamas antisemitism's rapid outbreak. At the heart of American Jewish conception was underestimating the combination of Israel's delegitimization and identity politics. Information existed before October 7, but assessment was wrong, reflecting twenty years of trends maturing into complete helplessness.[i]

Focus on Antisemitism from the Right

American Jews agree antisemitism is rising but are divided about primary sources. The main divide concerns whether the greater threat comes from extreme right (white supremacy) or extreme left (Red-Green Alliance), with views shaped by political affiliation and most liberal American Jews seeing right-wing threats as greatest. Since most American Jews are liberals, it is not surprising that a clear majority among mainstream American Jews perceived the threat from the right as the greatest threat.

The Jewish establishment adopted a 'conceptsia' seeing right-wing antisemitism as the real threat while viewing left-wing antisemitism as marginal nuisance. They didn't respond decisively to academic discrimination, Jewish exclusion due to white categorization, or developing 'soft' antisemitism in institutions.[ii]

The focus on right-wing antisemitism was reflected in Jewish organizations' agendas, media, and outreach activities. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt stated "white supremacists remain the 'greatest threat',[iii].  and an AJC survey showed 91% of American Jews were more concerned about extreme right antisemitism versus 71% about radical left.[iv]

It was easier to confront 'traditional' antisemitism from the right, which is unacceptable in mainstream America. Mainstream media and institutions respond with condemnation and sanctions to traditional antisemitic incidents, as seen with congressional attacks on antisemitic posts in 2021 or Adidas terminating Kanye West's contract.[v]

The vast majority of Jewish organizations did not condemn Jews' categorization as white in progressive discourse.[vi]  Mainstream American Jewish organizations downplayed Democratic Party antisemitism and didn't challenge DEI introduction into institutions. Even post-October 7, 30 Jewish organizations signed an open letter defending DEI in February 2025, including the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) - which should be at the forefront of fighting antisemitism in all its forms.[vii]

Research shows[viii] antisemitic prejudices are more common among right-wing versus left-wing individuals. Studies indicate greater conservative identification correlates with agreement to negative Jewish stereotypes. This document doesn't deny these findings but notes two important points:

First, pro-Hamas antisemitism doesn't rely mostly on blatant Jewish stereotyping but on discrimination resulting from Jews' categorization as white in progressive discourse. There's a tendency to measure antisemitism by standards fitting the phenomenon primarily from the political right.

Second, left-wing antisemitism's characteristics make it more dangerous to the Jewish community collectively and Jewish life in America. While right-wing antisemitism threatens individual security, pro-Hamas antisemitism undermines Jewish community status, weakens the establishment, and threatens Jewish identity existentially.

The Jewish focus on right-wing antisemitism while neglecting pro-Hamas antisemitism from the left is key to the fundamental surprise experienced by the Jewish community.

The Price of Universalizing Jewish Identity and the K-12 Challenge

Since mid-last century, mainstream American Jews increasingly saw commitment to universal values as expressing Jewish values rather than deviating from tradition. This trend legitimized Jewish involvement in American movements and made "Tikkun Olam" the ultimate expression of Jewish identity for mainstream American Jewry.[ix]

Over time, Jewish community divisions deepened regarding prioritized values. Shmuel Rosner writes that American Jewry's two main goals - Israel and Tikkun Olam - often compete, with "'Tikkun Olam' becoming a competing value rather than complementary to Zionism."[x]It is possible that the search for the common purpose of the dispersed and diverse Jewish community was what brought to the surface the great Jewish diversity and contributed significantly to the expansion of divisions and polarization among them.

Moreover, universalism eroded identification with Israel and Jewish solidarity, alongside growing criticism of Israeli policy. This accelerated through demographic changes and weakening Jewish establishments, prompting calls like that of the director of the Palo Alto Community Center, Zack Bodner, for examining leadership's failure to instill resilient Jewish identity.[xi]

Identity politics places Jews in an awkward position, as many feel they must choose between community loyalty and liberal values. Many adopt binary perception seeing themselves as white and privileged, exacerbating Jewish identity crisis.

The Jewish community lacks shared understanding regarding left-wing antisemitism's universalist framework. Many Jews don't oppose boycotts due to ambivalent attitudes toward Israel and reject claims of anti-Zionism/antisemitism overlap.

Polarization around Israel damages community cohesion and undermines American Jewish community's ability to advance interests. As organizations struggle to define common commitments, creating unified fronts against Jewish hatred becomes impossible.

This institutional weakness is acutely felt in the K-12 education system. Most Jewish children in the US attend public schools or private non-Jewish day schools (estimates range between 7%-20%[i] attend Jewish day schools). When a child encounters antisemitism in a public school - whether it's harassment from peers or subtle bias in a lesson plan - their parents often feel isolated, helpless, and unsure of how to respond. Many parents cannot even identify an act as antisemitic, especially when it is disguised as "legitimate criticism" of Israel or universal progressive activism. Unlike on university campuses, the Jewish ecosystem in K-12 is less structured, with no obvious "Jewish address" for parents to turn to. This leaves them without the support or guidance needed to advocate effectively for their children's safety and well-being.

Communal Organizations: A Struggle for Relevance and Action

Mainstream Jewish organizations, in their current form, are often ill-equipped to support the kind of hands-on political and social activism required to meet contemporary challenges. While the American Jewish community is historically influential and affluent, its major institutions have become increasingly specialized in fundraising and fund distribution rather than leading social causes or grassroots movements. This has led to a leadership model often managed by professional bureaucrats focused on budgets, rather than charismatic leaders capable of mobilizing a groundswell of popular support.

This operational structure has contributed to a decline in the relevance of traditional Jewish communal organizations, especially for younger generations who, reflecting a broader societal trend, harbor mistrust toward centralized institutions. Jewish organizations have lost much of their "street cred" and the "on-the-ground" presence that once defined their role in pivotal social movements. In the past, the Jewish community relations field played a leading role in efforts like the civil rights movement and the campaign to free Soviet Jewry, building a powerful infrastructure of relationships and mobilizing the community for action.

However, as the community's socioeconomic status improved, these organizations seemed to lose their ability to be recognized as legitimate allies to other disempowered groups. This has created a vacuum in grassroots infrastructure, making it exceedingly difficult for the Jewish community - and particularly its community relations organizations - to effectively counter the current wave of anti-Israel sentiment and antisemitism at the local level. The very bodies designed to build bridges and mobilize against threats now find themselves challenged by internal fragmentation and a diminished capacity for broad, hands-on engagement.

Losing the street: Lack of 'Relevance' to the mainstream

The Jewish community mistakenly believes the pro-Israel network is at numerical disadvantage and can only achieve tactical successes. However, studies show Israel's hardcore support base is larger than the anti-Israel base, and Israel also enjoys a greater mainstream sympathy compared to the Palestinians.[ii]The conclusion is that the Red-Green Alliance is more effective in translating sympathy into activism.

In other words: The Jewish community fails to frame the fight against antisemitism and anti-Zionism in a way that would translate the broad sympathy for Israel in the American public into active support. The result is an illusion that sympathy for Israel represents a minority and the Jewish community is doomed to fight a hopeless rearguard battle because "the whole world is against us."

Thus, American Jewry and Israel are losing the battle for 'relevance' in the street to the swayable majority. Israel is losing support among audiences left of center, mostly liberal Democratic Party voters who don't have a solid position toward Israel. Israel loses support among liberal Democratic voters without solid positions. Despite the 'Tikkun Olam industry' and widespread Jewish activism, the Jewish community found itself relatively isolated fighting current antisemitism.

The conclusion: The Jewish community lost its "street cred" not because of abandoning activism, but due to failure creating an updated relevant narrative for Jewish life in America.

The Red-Green Alliance succeeded in becoming relevant to liberal audiences globally. Campus takeovers and academic boycotts evidence pro-Israel failure to win relevance battles. Their secret was correctly identifying social trends, taking over power centers, and updating narratives accordingly, particularly connecting anti-Israel agenda in the US to identity politics and Black anti-racism struggles.

Interestingly, we note that the 'strategy for relevance' of the Red-Green Alliance differs in each Western country. For example,  In South Africa, the connection to the ruling ANC party and labor unions has made 'Israel' a flagship issue in South African politics; In Britain, anti-Israel forces identified academia and labor unions as platforms through which they could inject their agenda into the mainstream;[iii] In Canada, the combination of identity politics, takeover of trade unions, and institutionalization of Islamist organizations explains their success in advancing their agenda.

Most young campus protesters aren't motivated by primordial antisemitism or Palestinian solidarity, but perceive their actions as part of America's internal anti-racism struggle. Hamas appears to them as brown people fighting a white colonial state, demonstrating the Red-Green Alliance's success in making their struggle "relevant."

The Unfolding Crisis on Campus

American university campuses have become a significant stage for the display of anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Jewish students face a hostile environment, including verbal and physical assaults, vandalism, and widespread online harassment. This hostility is also present in academia, with some curricula and university policies being discriminatory. This atmosphere of exclusion often leads to the marginalization of Jewish students from campus groups. A year-long investigation by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce concluded that this surge in campus antisemitism resulted directly from the failures of university administrators.[iv]

Concurrently, the current administration has initiated a campaign against 'wokeism' in academia, issuing presidential orders to dismantle federal diversity and inclusion programs and ending affirmative action in federal contracts. A special task force was established to combat antisemitism in universities, leading to some institutions, like Harvard, adopting the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The administration has also taken strong measures against universities like Harvard and Columbia, including threatening to revoke tax-exempt status, freezing federal funding, and restricting student admissions

These actions have sparked protests over concerns about freedom of expression and academic independence. Many in the Jewish community are wary that these measures, [v] while ostensibly for their protection, could position them as pawns in a larger political agenda, with some fearing it's a pretext to fundamentally alter American society.[vi]

However, the authors of this document believe that the "messenger" should not invalidate the strategy. The argument is that if framing antisemitism as a threat to fundamental American values is effective, then concerns about who is proffering this framing become secondary. To let such concerns hinder this approach risks repeating past mistakes where the Jewish community failed to address new and insidious forms of antisemitism.

The big of the American Jewish community, it’s the lack of relevance of its institution to the vulnerable Jewish students. According to a survey by ADL, Hillel International, and College Pulse, 83%[i] of ~350,000-420,000 Jewish students[ii] across North America have experienced or witnessed antisemitism since October 7th, but only 20% of them engage meaningfully[iii] with Jewish organizations on campus.

Activating the ‘long tail’ of Jewish students is key to changing the campus dynamic. The election of Maya Platek, an Israeli student involved with Students Supporting Israel (SSI), as the student body president of Columbia University amidst campus encampments is a powerful indication that a silent majority exists even in the most troubling of American academic arenas. [iv]

Strategic Inferiority on Social Media Bolsters the Illusion of Numerical Inferiority

Social networks have become the main arena for promoting pro-Hamas antisemitism. Hostile elements successfully spread systematic disinformation and hate content on social networks, and they benefit from algorithms that amplify extreme content. The messages of these elements are simple and catchy, and they do not encounter any coherent pro-Israel narrative in the digital space that challenges them.[v]

Social networks are decentralized with multiple actors, including state involvement. Most antisemitism generators are unaffiliated individuals, but Red-Green Alliance organizations encourage activism, and states fund massive bot networks, including Iranian cyber groups and influence from Qatar, Turkey, Russia, China, and others.[vi]

Pro-Israel activism fails to push back against the anti-Israel 'tsunami' online. Most activity mirrors anti-Israel efforts through training influencers, content development, and monitoring hate (the organization 'Fighting Online Antisemitism' leads in this front),[vii] with technological innovation from Israeli startups, but hasn't changed pro-Israel online inferiority. Pro-Israel activity features technological innovation with startup nation civil bodies making technologies accessible for the cause, but hasn't changed pro-Israel online inferiority.

'Diplomatic' attempts by Jewish organizations to change social media policies yielded some results but haven't changed the overall picture. Examples include World Jewish Congress[viii] collaborating with UNESCO and Facebook for policy changes, and federation lobbying contributing to TikTok Act legislation.

The accepted definitions of antisemitism allow antisemitism from the left to flourish. There is a tendency to measure antisemitism in terms that suit the phenomenon from the political right, which relies on blatant stereotyping of Jews. Thus, even when a decrease in the volume of antisemitism online or the removal of antisemitic content is reported, they mostly do not relate to antisemitism that comes from the left. Even the IHRA definition doesn't address Jews' white framing underlying their discrimination.

The failure to deal with online antisemitism is embodied in numbers showing huge content gaps that validate "numerical inferiority conception." Northeastern University data shows nearly 5,000 daily anti-Israel TikTok posts versus 275 pro-Israel posts (18:1 ratio), with anti-Israel content receiving 6.5 million daily views versus 400,000 pro-Israel views. [ix]

Social networks accelerate 'collective illusions,' meaning clear data may not reflect majority opinion in Western countries. Professor Todd Rose[x] describes how networks give disproportionate voice to extremes, creating mistaken perceptions of broad support for minority positions. People publicly express positions they don't believe because they wrongly think others hold them, leading to moderate voice silencing.

Collective illusions were decisive in Jewish community's post-October 7 surprise. Social networks created false progressive youth consensus supporting Hamas. While public surveys showed 50-60% Generation Z support, privately only 10-11% supported Hamas, plummeting to 2% by mid-2024. This sharp decline indicates collective illusion explosion, where anti-Israel content promotion and algorithmic manipulation created false consensus appearances.[xi]

Collective illusions may become self-fulfilling prophecies: believing peers support anti-Israel positions leads to self-censorship allowing these positions to percolate into consciousness. Persistent illusions may shape future private opinions as social lies become personal values. Data from the Harvard Harris Poll[xii] in May 2025 shows Hamas support jumping to 50% among youth. This is likely due to renewed Gaza fighting and Trump university actions creating false peer identification illusions.

The Less-Discussed Israeli ‘Conceptsia’

Israel's diplomatic isolation and pro-Hamas antisemitism wave largely result from fixation in non-security areas. While the IDF achieved impressive results, Israel's foreign affairs system operates chaotically without coordination, unified messaging, or integration across government ministries handling different diplomatic dimensions.

Israel is suffering complete defeat in the diplomatic-political field. Despite optimal public diplomacy conditions after October 7, Israel lost international sympathy within weeks, becoming effectively a 'pariah' with dramatic support drops in friendly countries and arms embargoes from Italy, Britain, Canada, and US delays.[i]

The diplomatic defeat derives from viewing politics as secondary to security considerations. Israel's conduct indicates underestimation of diplomatic importance and the Muqawama axis's implosion plan. Since late 2023, the war's center of gravity moved to diplomacy where Israel suffered repeated defeats, lacking a "diplomatic-political IDF" for complex moves.

'Israeli mess' in the foreign affairs system. Multiple ministries manage semi-independent foreign relations with loose coordination and no integrating factor, including PMO, IDF Spokesperson, Tourism, Justice, Immigrant Absorption, and Economy. Even national institutions like Jewish Agency operate with only partial government coordination, with foreign affairs experts often absent from national security assessments.

Israel's diplomatic room for maneuver narrowed due to clear diplomatic failures during war, primarily unwillingness to set political goals[ii] (such as diplomatic pressure on Egypt to open its gates to refugees - see "Let Their People Go or Dissolving UNRWA") and limited actions preventing Gaza humanitarian crisis. [iii] Israel failed to prevent Biden administration conflicts and lead complex diplomatic moves, with Trump's entry reflecting luck rather than Israeli diplomatic wisdom.

The pro-Hamas antisemitism wave reflects Israeli diplomatic failure much greater than relevant government bodies' responsibility. Israel failed to address commitment erosion in the Democratic Party, where progressives introduced anti-Israel discourse, transforming Israel from bipartisan consensus to polarized issue. While senior Democratic leadership maintains traditional support, younger progressives push for policy changes including conditioning military aid, with polls showing growing Republican-Democrat gaps.

A Brief History of the Failed Governmental Response to the Delegitimization Campaign

From 1948-2009, the Foreign Ministry led the fight against antisemitism and anti-Zionism without formal designated authority. Since 2009 and 2010 (respectively), other headquarters-based government ministries are officially entrusted with leading the fight against antisemitism and the delegitimization of Israel. For the first time, the current government assigns both antisemitism and delegitimization to one ministry - Diaspora Affairs and Fight Against Antisemitism.

2010 is considered the watershed year in government's approach to delegitimization as a distinct threat:

The Goldstone Report on Operation Cast Lead and Gaza Flotilla gave impetus to Israel boycotts, accelerated diplomatic isolation threats, and served as wake-up calls regarding political and civil arena threats.

The Reut Institute was a pioneer in analyzing and understanding the unique characteristics of the delegitimization phenomenon, and many of its recommendations in a report published before the Herzliya Conference in 2009 were adopted by the government and Jewish organizations in the Diaspora.[iv]

Between 2010-2014, the pro-Israel network achieved significant achievements pushing back antisemitism and delegitimization waves. In every arena, Israel and Jewish communities prevented boycotts and sanctions, thwarted Gaza flotilla campaigns, and blocked legal attacks, including UN Palmer Report validation of Gaza blockade legality, reflecting effective global cooperation.[v]

However, the 'golden age' was very short (2010~2014). After relative success, government began underestimating the challenge, with relevant ministries working in silos outside national security conversations. Despite no formal decision, government conduct reflected growing underestimation, with increasing politicization damaging Israel's ability to work effectively with pro-Israel networks.

However, these don't explain the de-professionalization and superficiality process in government ministries handling the challenge: from bodies designed to build professional pro-Israel networks, they became PR showcase operations focusing on superficial advocacy not targeting relevant audiences. Due to sensitivity, we won't elaborate in this public version.[vi]

Israel arrived at October 8 with foreign affairs apparatus irrelevant to the challenge. Even today, government ministries work without coordination, antisemitism focus is separated from diplomatic and security challenges, and government tools are limited.

The Government Response During the War: 'Fifty Shades of Hasbara'

Various Israeli foreign affairs units fought fiercely in rearguard battles. Facing unprecedented assault on diplomatic, legal, and media fronts, Israel consciously decided to present almost uncensored massacre documentation to shock world opinion and establish war legitimacy. A significant civilian public diplomacy system developed, led by global Jewish communities.

However, the bitter truth is that even all these actions were far from effective. Israel did not even succeed in preventing foreign media from relying on sources from the murderous terrorist organization Hamas over Israeli sources.

Even Israel's creative actions in this arena were not the product of a comprehensive strategy. The division of powers and lack of coordination between bodies responsible for different dimensions of Israel's foreign policy was reflected in a lack of coherence in messages and approaches. Coordination between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, the IDF Spokesperson, the Prime Minister's Office, and other bodies was very loose at best, creating duplications and contradictions in Israeli conduct. A significant part of the challenge for the foreign apparatus was to deal with "fires" caused by slips of the tongue from 'undisciplined' ministers, spontaneous declarations, or uncoordinated actions by government bodies on foreign affairs issues.

Israel's main approach was based on what could be called the "Hasbara paradigm," which reflected a tendency to see the outbreak of antisemitism as a technical problem with a technical solution. However, the 'Hasbara' paradigm failed because attempts to explain the conflict through articulate spokespersons presenting historical facts do not connect to the value-conceptual framework through which the younger generation interprets reality.

The almost exclusive reliance on military spokespersons in uniforms to deal with political and humanitarian issues could not have succeeded. Although IDF spokespersons mostly did a good job under difficult conditions, they encountered natural suspicion when addressing political and humanitarian issues. Amateurish mistakes reflected a lack of understanding of the target audience, such as releasing the video of Sinwar's killing, which was supposed to be a message of victory but turned him into a mythical figure among Palestinians.

At the same time, the diversion of resources to developing technological solutions to the challenge was mostly unhelpful because these were operated without a rich conceptual framework. As the war continued, Israel began to make adjustments by increasing digital advocacy budgets and forming collaborations with influencers. However, the fundamental problems of lack of coherence, lack of coordination, and the gap between Israeli messages and the value framework of target audiences remained. Technology cannot alone bridge conceptual gaps, and Hamas often succeeded in "taking over the narrative" on social networks, gradually presenting Israel as a cruel aggressor rather than the victim.

The Playbook for Jewish and Pro-Israeli Leadership in North America

Play #1: Define the End Zone — Neutralize Normalization

The mission is not to eradicate antisemitism entirely—an unattainable goal. The single, unifying objective of this playbook is to aggressively halt and reverse the normalization of antisemitism in the mainstream. This strategic focus is critical. It transforms an endless fight into a winnable campaign with a defined, measurable, and achievable goal. Every subsequent play and tactic must be measured against this core objective: Are we making antisemitism less acceptable in public discourse and institutions? This clarity enables focused planning, resource allocation, and the ability to track concrete results.

Play #2: Reframe the Battlefield - A Threat to America, Not Just the Jews

To win, we must change the narrative. The old framing of antisemitism as a uniquely Jewish problem is a strategic dead end. The new approach is to position it as what it has become: a direct assault on American identity and Western democratic values.

This play has two key moves:

Shift the Focus: Frame the current wave of Jew-hatred as a symptom of progressive extremism that threatens all of America. When protesters burn American flags and call for the disruption of the American social order, they show their hand. The fight against Israel is a proxy war; their true target is the foundational principles of the West.

Abandon the "Canary": The "canary in the coal mine" metaphor, which treats antisemitism as an early warning of a future problem, is obsolete and ineffective. We must define pro-Hamas antisemitism as a clear and present challenge to American society today. It is one of many parallel threats—alongside attacks on meritocracy, pluralism, and free speech—that stem from the same radical source.

Play #3: Flip the Mindset — Act Like the Majority You Are

Our single greatest handicap is a psychological one. We operate with a "minority mindset" - the mistaken belief that we are fighting a rearguard battle against an overwhelmingly popular narrative. This is a delusion, born from loud opposition and social media's "collective illusions". Polling data consistently reveals that core support for Israel is significantly larger than the anti-Israel base.  To win, we must abandon the defensive crouch and adopt the confident, proactive strategy of a majority. This requires a two-pronged approach: a proud external posture and a decisive internal one.

The External Play: Project Confidence and Go on Offense - A majority doesn't apologize for its existence. We must stop fighting on our detractors' terms - constantly defending against bad-faith accusations of "privilege" and "colonialism". Instead, we must proactively assert a confident, vibrant, and particularistic Jewish identity. This means championing Zionism as a decolonization movement and framing the fight against pro-Hamas antisemitism not as a narrow Jewish problem, but as a defense of Western democratic values against an illiberal threat.

The Internal Play: Build Resilience and Define Red Lines - A majority has the confidence to maintain internal discipline. We must invest heavily in educational frameworks that build a proud Zionist identity, inoculating our youth against the corrosive identity politics that pits them against their own heritage. This also requires leadership to clearly define its red lines, refusing to allow the entire communal agenda to be held hostage by internal fringe voices who have adopted the opposition's arguments

Key Tactic: Activate the Silent Campus Majority - The myth of our numerical inferiority is shattered on campus. The mission is to activate the vast "long tail" of Jewish students - an estimated 70-80% of the more than 350,000 on campus - who face antisemitism but remain isolated and unengaged with traditional organizations. These students distrust the establishment's reactive responses.

Instead of funneling them into existing structures, we must empower them where they are. Provide clarity and strategic tools that enable them to act independently, choosing their own level of engagement. This will transform the silent majority into an active, visible force, decisively breaking the collective illusion that we are outnumbered.

Play #4: Shattering the Collective Illusion

A majority strategy requires dismantling the "collective illusion" that sustains the minority mindset. The apparent numerical inferiority of the pro-Israel voice, especially online, does not reflect public opinion. It is a product of social dynamics that amplify extreme voices, silence moderates, and create a distorted perception of consensus. Breaking this illusion must be a central goal of all communal activity A multi-dimensional attack is required to reclaim the public square from this distortion:

Move 1: Educate and Build Immunity: The first step is to recognize the "collective illusion" as a primary strategic threat. Leadership must educate community members, donors, and allies about how this phenomenon works, explaining that the online "tsunami" is not a reflection of reality but a manufactured consensus. This understanding transforms despair into resolve and empowers individuals to speak out, knowing they are not alone.

Move 2: Wage Strategic Diplomacy with Big Tech: We must move beyond ad-hoc requests and engage in sustained, strategic diplomacy with technology giants. This includes leveraging our communal and coalition influence to demand greater algorithmic transparency, the active disruption of hostile bot networks that create false amplification, and the consistent enforcement of policies against hate that address the unique characteristics of pro-Hamas antisemitism.

Move 3: Build a Superior Tech Arsenal: The community must leverage its resources and the innovative power of the "startup nation" to develop and deploy counter-tools. This means investing in AI-driven solutions to identify and counter coordinated disinformation campaigns, map the flow of hostile narratives, and empower the pro-Israel network with superior data and digital capabilities.

Play #5: Go on Offense - Dismantle the Red-Green Alliance

A defensive posture is a losing one. To win, we must actively dismantle the alliance that fuels the ideological assault against us. This requires executing four simultaneous offensive moves designed to break their connections, expose their contradictions, create consequences, and build our own alliances.

Move 1: Capture the High Ground - We must systematically influence the social and political power centers that the opposition has co-opted. This requires building long-term programs to promote allies to university boards of trustees, cultivate the next generation of newspaper editors, support friendly labor unions, and build influence within the political system, the judiciary, and corporate America.

Move 2: Drive the Wedge - Exploit the glaring ideological contradictions within the Red-Green alliance. We must aggressively highlight the chasm between the liberal left's stated values - such as women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and religious freedom - and the conservative, oppressive positions of their Islamist partners. Exposing these contradictions is a powerful leverage point that will undermine their coalition and weaken their joint power.

Move 3: Create a "Price Tag" - We will impose real-world consequences for antisemitic activity. This comprehensive strategy will expose the operational and financial links between Islamist organizations in the West and terrorist groups or their state sponsors, like Qatar. Action must be taken to sever foreign funding, expose their true anti-democratic agenda, and create a clear social, economic, and legal price tag for the perpetrators of antisemitism.

Move 4: Empower New Allies - It must be assumed that most Muslims in America do not identify with the Muslim Brotherhood's radical agenda. Therefore, we will identify and strengthen anti-Islamist forces within Western Muslim communities, such as the Clarity Coalition. Empowering these diverse voices helps build a powerful counter-narrative from within the very communities our opponents claim to represent

Play #6: Build the 'Big Tent' Coalition

An offensive strategy is impossible without allies. We must move beyond our own echo chambers and build a broad, powerful coalition of partners who share our core interest in defending American democratic values. This play is built on four pillars.

Pillar 1: Rebuild Our Diplomatic Corps - We must immediately strengthen the community relations apparatus - the de facto "foreign ministry" of the Jewish community. This crucial function, responsible for building relationships outside our community, has atrophied significantly since the 1990s and must be revitalized to professionalize our outreach at both local and national levels.

Pillar 2: Forge a Coalition of the Targeted - There is a unique opportunity to unite various groups who are also discriminated against by the rigid framework of progressive discourse. The Jewish community, being the most significantly harmed by a focused campaign, has a unique and critical role to play in leading these diverse coalitions and partnerships with other minority groups.

Pillar 3: Activate the Sympathetic Majority - Our strategy must shift its focus from the small, already-committed pro-Israel camp to the much larger camp of non-Jews who show sympathy for Israel. These are people who perceive the current wave of antisemitism and extremism as a direct threat to their own way of life and values. This is where we find the numbers to win.

Pillar 4: Make Pluralism the Rallying Cry - The common ground for this "Big Tent" coalition is the preservation of American pluralism. The Jewish community must serve as a voice of reason. While fighting antisemitism on the left, we must simultaneously work to preserve and promote the pluralistic society that has enabled the unprecedented prosperity and security of all minority groups, including our own.

Play #7: Particularistic Response: Focus on Jewish Serving Elite

An effective external strategy requires a strong, resilient, and coherent community. We must turn inward to fortify our foundations, transforming the current chaotic response into an effective decentralized one. This play is guided by a core strategic reversal.

The Core Strategy: The Great Reversal - For too long, many have adopted universal values while framing antisemitism as a particular Jewish problem. This is a losing formula. The playbook calls for a complete reversal. Internally: We must emphasize particular Jewish values and a proud identity; Externally: We must universalize the fight against antisemitism, framing it as a threat to all (See Play #2).

Move 1: Champion Proud Particularism - We will shift focus from universalism to a proud and active Zionist Judaism. This means investing in an educational approach that elevates the core values of Jewish mutual responsibility and Hebrew studies.

Move 2: Immediate emphasis should be on ensuring Jewish serving elite, professionals and lay, adopt a more particular Jewish approach.

Move 3: Re-engineer Jewish Education - The fact that many young Jews have internalized narratives that label them "white" and "privileged" is evidence of a failure in our educational frameworks. Jewish schools and institutions, both formal and informal, must be re-engineered to build confident identities immune to this corrosive discourse.

Move 4: Deepen the Israel Connection - The tragedy of October 7th creates a powerful opportunity to forge an updated, emotional bond between American Jews and Israel, reversing years of a widening gap. For many, the connection to the Jewish state has become inescapable. The most effective tool for strengthening this tie is exposing American Jews to the diverse, human faces of Israeli society.

Play #8: Expose and Disarm the Weaponization of Language:

Antisemitic activists deploy “dual-use terminology” to troll, confuse, and divide Jewish communities. These ambiguous phrases derail debate, erode safe spaces, and infiltrate school environments. Five moves:

Identify and Catalog: Map the most common weaponized terms and phrases.

Train Jewish Serving Elite for Counterplay: Equip leaders, educators, and students with language tools to flip the script and expose the tactic in real time.

Set Institutional Boundaries: Push schools, universities, and workplaces to recognize and act against the misuse of such language as harassment.

Apply a ‘Jewish standard’ in Jewish public spaces to ‘dual-use’ terminology, which often aims at challenge the Jewish lived experience.

Recruit Allies from the Jewish Left - The left's support for Hamas has created a moment of profound cognitive dissonance for many progressive Jews who now feel betrayed. This creates a strategic opening leverage their discomfort to acknowledge their recognition of the double standards and dual use terminology within progressive circles to recruit them.

State-Level Playbook

This section outlines the necessary paradigm shift for the Government of Israel, moving from a fragmented response to a unified national security strategy. Today it is clear that pro-Hamas antisemitism is an integral part of the destruction doctrine of Israel's enemies in the region, and therefore it should be defined as a national security issue. This framing requires serious and coordinated governmental treatment of the phenomenon.

Directive #1: Redefine Victory

The national security paradigm must shift from defining victory solely by battlefield results to defining it by the strategic political trends that emerge from it. Since the enemy's primary goal is to make Israel a pariah, true victory should also be measured by achieving a stronger strategic and diplomatic position after a conflict.

Israel must adopt a new national security paradigm where its international standing is a core strategic principle. This means high level of ‘legitimacy’ and diplomatic outcomes are no longer a secondary effect of military action, but a primary consideration that shapes military goals from the outset.

True victory is not just winning on the battlefield but defeating the enemy's central strategy of turning Israel into a pariah. Therefore, military and political moves must be fully integrated to leverage tactical success into strategic gains, such as building a new regional architecture that solidifies Israel's legitimacy and power.

Align Military and Political Action. The lack of this alignment was a central failure in the war, reducing Israel's military maneuvering space and inflaming global antisemitism as a direct result of political, diplomatic, and humanitarian failures.

The Mission: We must plan to defeat Qatar at Harvard with the same strategic rigor we use to defeat Iran in Fordow. Every military operation must be designed and leveraged to create a more favorable political reality.

Directive #2: Redefine the Threat as a National Security Issue

The State’s approach to fighting antisemitism and delegitimization must be fundamentally reframed.

The Core Directive: Frame Antisemitism as a National Security Threat. For too long, antisemitism and delegitimization have been treated as "soft threats". This is a critical error. Pro-Hamas antisemitism is an integral component of the destruction doctrine of Israel's enemies and must be officially defined as a national security issue. This framing mandates a serious, coordinated governmental response.

Establish a Central Command. The national security designation requires an integrating factor at the highest level - the Prime Minister's Office, the National Security Council, or the Foreign Ministry. The current model, where responsibility lies with ministries that only handle marginal dimensions of the phenomenon, is obsolete.

Directive #3: Establishing a National Authority

A national statutory authority dedicated to combating antisemitism is urgently needed. The complexity and scope of the threat require a professional, empowered executive body with clear authority, budget, and operational independence - one that can ensure continuity and long-term strategic planning.

This authority could be modeled after successful initiatives that began as “incubation units” within existing ministries and later evolved into independent agencies - such as the Government ICT Authority or the National Emergency Authority. During its initial incubation phase, this task force would be responsible for shaping a national strategy, mapping stakeholders and gaps, developing a multi-year work plan, and coordinating early-stage operations across government ministries and security bodies. Once viability is demonstrated and an effective operational doctrine is developed, the unit would transition into a fully independent authority, functioning as the government's dedicated executive arm in this domain.

This national authority would serve as a central coordinating body, applying the “Catalyst Approach” described in the next recommendation. It would not replace the Foreign Ministry or civil society actors, but rather centralize and amplify their efforts. Key advantages of such an authority include:

Continuity and Stability - As a statutory body, it would be more insulated from frequent political turnover, ensuring consistent, long-term policy - unlike ministries tied to specific political appointments.

Professionalism and Focus - The authority would act as a national knowledge center, allowing for specialization, institutional memory, and a data-driven approach rooted in research and intelligence—not reactive media cycles.

Breaking Government Silos - It would act as an empowered integrator, compelling all relevant ministries (Foreign Affairs, Diaspora Affairs, Justice, Economy, etc.) and security agencies to coordinate under a unified national strategy, reducing duplication and waste.

A Single Address for the Global Network - It would serve as a clear, centralized point of contact for Jewish and pro-Israel organizations worldwide, enabling the state to efficiently share intelligence, tech tools, diplomatic and legal support, and other resources in a synchronized way.

Directive #4: The Catalyst Approach - Empower the Network

The state's central role is not to directly lead every fight like an activist, but to act as a catalyst and "enabler" for the global pro-Israel network.

The Premise: Leverage Unique State Positioning. The Israeli government possesses a unique and irreproducible advantage: its formal "state capabilities" and its informal authority as the nation-state of the Jewish people. This strategic asset must be fully leveraged to empower, integrate, and professionalize the diverse civil society organizations already on the ground.

The State's Unique Arsenal: The government will focus on providing unique, high-level capabilities that civil society cannot access alone. The primary contributions are:

Intelligence & Information: State systems will provide the network with critical intelligence on hostile financing, organizational links, and coordinated digital campaigns.

Strategic Diplomacy: The government will lead the diplomatic effort to embed the IHRA definition of antisemitism as a global standard.

Directive #5: Shared-Values Approach is Declining, Re-found the US Alliance on Interests

The old foundation of the US-Israel relationship - a shared "covenant" of values - is crumbling. This narrative is actively alienating the growing isolationist "America First" right and the progressive left. Continuing to use this language is now a strategic liability. The alliance must be urgently re-founded on a clear-eyed, sober discourse of mutual strategic interests.

Proactively work to shift the relationship from unilateral "aid" to bilateral "joint investment". This reframes the entire dynamic, positioning Israel as an innovative partner in defense, technology, and intelligence - an asset to be partnered with, not a problem to be managed.

Focus on American benefit. Frame Israel as a powerful, self-reliant strategic asset that: Serves as a crucial check on state sponsors of terror; Provides unique intelligence and battlefield innovations; Co-develops vital military technology that keeps America safer.

Project power and partnership: The core message to all Americans must be that a strong, independent Israel is a net strategic gain for the United States. This single, interest-based argument simultaneously appeals to the Right’s desire for powerful allies and undermines the Left’s dependency narrative.

Summary

The fight against antisemitism in North America requires a fundamental paradigm shift - from a defensive approach to an offensive approach, from a Jewish particularistic framing to a broad American framing, and from focusing on the committed audience to expanding to broader audiences. The success of the strategy depends on the ability to connect the strengthening of particularistic Jewish identity with the building of broad alliances for America's democratic and pluralistic values.

These challenges require a sophisticated and multi-dimensional state approach. We hope that the recommendations in this document will contribute to the development of effective national policy, while recognizing the complexity of the threat and the need for coordinated and innovative action.

Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik's essay "Kol Dodi Dofek," profoundly influenced mainstream American Jewry, beyond the boundaries of the Orthodoxy to which he belonged. In his essay, Soloveitchik distinguished between the covenant of fate of the Jewish people (a passive connection based on shared experiences) and the covenant of destiny, which is an active covenant, where Jews unite around a common purpose, values, and religious commitments.

Israel didn't use post-October 7 sympathy to advance its agenda, refused revitalized Palestinian Authority without presenting alternatives, then faced unilateral Palestinian state recognition and American pressure.

Absence of humanitarian aid infrastructure became the main anchor damaging Israel's international status while preserving Hamas control, lacking declared political goals to structure humanitarian infrastructure.

The Reut Institute, Building a Political Firewall against Israel’s delegitimization, March, 2010. The report had a huge effect on the field. Strategic Affairs Ministry led global pro-Israel network creation, while delegitimization was framed as national security leading to Prime Minister declarations and dedicated intelligence arrays. In the Jewish world, 2010 events led to renewed organization against delegitimization and antisemitism with new bodies, updated concepts, coalitions, and increased cooperation.

On these successes, one can read in the Reut Institute report 2011: The Year We Punched Back on the Assault on Israel's legitimacy, November 2011.

Text: ROME, September 22. /TASS/. A rally in support of Palestine in Milan has ended in clashes with the police.

According to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, 60 policemen sustained injuries and at least ten protesters were detained.

Especially aggressive activists broke through fences at the central railway station resulting in a temporary suspension of rail traffic. The demonstration itself was marred by vandalism.

In Rome, a rally attended by students ended in activists taking over one of the departments of Sapienza University. This was more of a symbolic move as thesis defenses taking place at the time were not interrupted, the ANSA news agency reported.

Minor incidents have also been reported in other cities where pro-Palestinian rallies were held. All these protests were tied with a strike affecting public transportation and educational institutions declared by a number of trade unions. The strike’s participants oppose the war economy, increased military spending and arms deliveries to conflict zones.

Violent clashes erupted Friday between police and Islamists in Pakistan’s eastern city of Lahore after security forces tried to stop thousands of demonstrators from leaving for the capital, Islamabad, where they planned to stage a pro-Palestinian rally outside the US Embassy, officials said.

The clashes in the capital of Punjab province began Thursday but intensified Friday after police baton-charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to disperse them at multiple locations. Protesters hurled stones at officers in response.

In a statement, the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan party, or TLP, claimed that two of its supporters had been killed and 50 others injured since Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the Punjab provincial government, which is headed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of the prime minister.

The protest comes after Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan brokered by US President Donald Trump.

Speaking to thousands of worshippers in Lahore at Friday prayers, TLP chief Saad Rizvi announced the march, saying, “We will now march from Lahore to the US Embassy” in Islamabad.

“I will walk at the head of the long march. Arrest is not a problem, bullets are not a problem, shells are not a problem — martyrdom is our destiny,” Rizvi said.

Police officers were swinging batons and firing tear gas to disperse demonstrators near the main TLP office, according to witnesses, who said residents also faced severe difficulties because of the tear gas.

However, the demonstrators were staying along a highway in Lahore for a night, and TLP and witnesses said police were using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the rallygoers. In Islamabad, deputy Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters that the demonstrators would not be allowed to enter Islamabad at any costs.

Chaudhry said on Friday that Palestinians were celebrating peace and TLP was still holding a violent rally. He questioned “TLP’s motive behind this protest.” He said all arrangements are in place to stop the rallygoers from entering the capital to create chaos.

The violence has disrupted daily life in parts of Lahore, as residents struggled to reach home because of road closures and continued clashes.

On Friday, authorities shut schools, colleges and universities in Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people.

The government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has suspended mobile internet service in Islamabad and nearby Rawalpindi as part of measures aimed at preventing demonstrators from reaching the national capital.

Authorities have also placed shipping containers along the main motorway, the main highways and roads leading to Islamabad to block protesters.

Lahore is about 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Islamabad.

The US Embassy in Islamabad issued a security alert ahead of the march, warning of possible disruptions and urging American citizens to exercise caution.

“Large crowds and traffic congestion are expected, along with a precautionary security presence, an increased number of checkpoints, and associated disruptions to local mobile and internet networks in the region,” the embassy said, adding that the duration of the protests is unknown.

It advised US citizens to avoid large gatherings, remain aware of their surroundings and keep a low profile.

Deputy Interior Minister Chaudhry said earlier on Thursday that the TLP had not submitted a request for permission to hold the rally. The group denied the claim, saying it had applied for permission for a peaceful march to express solidarity with Palestinians.

The TLP, known for staging disruptive and sometimes violent protests, has drawn criticism online. But many users have accused the government of overreacting by blocking roads even before the demonstrators began their march.

“Why are these demonstrators coming to Islamabad for the rally when the peace process has already started in Palestine?” asked Mohammad Ashfaq, 35, as he turned back from a road block in Islamabad.

He said he tried using longer routes to reach the city, but police had also blocked those roads with shipping containers. “Now I’ll have to figure out again how to reach my office,” he said.

The British government banned Palestine Action under an antiterrorism law, but an intelligence document said most of its activity “would not be classified as terrorism.”

By Jane BradleyAdam Goldman and Lizzie Dearden

Reporting from London

The British government has fiercely defended its decision to ban a pro-Palestinian group under a decades-old terrorism statute, a designation reserved mainly for Islamic militants and neo-Nazis.

The rationale to outlaw the group, Palestine Action, was based on “clear advice and intelligence” after an “escalating campaign involving intimidation and sustained criminal damage,” Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said on Monday. Activists from the group have vandalized weapon factories and military equipment.

Mr. Jarvis said the group showed a willingness “to use violence in pursuit of its cause” and suggested supporters “may not know the extent of its activities.” Hundreds protesting the ban were arrested last weekend under the law, which also criminalizes public displays of support for groups categorized as terrorist organizations. Typically, such forms of expression are protected in Britain.

But an intelligence assessment that helped shape the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action undercuts some officials’ broad claims about why it named the group a terrorist organization. A declassified version of the report obtained by The New York Times said a “majority of the group’s activity would not be classified as terrorism” under Britain’s legal definition.

An intelligence assessment that British officials relied on to ban Palestine Action.

It also casts doubt on the government’s suggestion that Palestine Action sought to promote violence against people, a tactic typical of other groups banned under the terrorism law, which include Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.

Members of the group do face serious criminal charges, which stem from episodes that are mentioned in the assessment. Prosecutors have accused one Palestine Action activist of wielding a sledgehammer in an assault that injured two police officers during a break-in last year at a building that belongs to Elbit Systems, an Israeli weapon manufacturer.

Prosecutors have accused others of property crimes, and the group has a manual that “provides practical advice and advocates for serious property damage,” the assessment said. It also noted that the group had publicized its attacks. One of the group’s founders was charged separately with expressing support for Hamas, a designated terrorist group in Britain and the United States, which he denies.

Britain’s Home Office, which is responsible for law enforcement and national security, referred questions from The Times about the report to the government’s legal department. Officials there warned that legal restrictions applied to “certain information” in the report.

Government officials, including Mr. Jarvis, have said repeatedly that they relied on intelligence advice in deciding whether to ban Palestine Action. The assessment, from March 7, was compiled by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Center, Britain’s independent authority for terrorism assessment within MI5, the domestic intelligence service. The declassified version of the assessment does not provide a complete accounting of the intelligence that police and counterterrorism officials might have collected about the group. A former British diplomat who now writes a blog previously published the report.

The assessment, which detailed Palestine Action’s activities, paints a more nuanced picture of the group than some of British officials’ most critical statements.

For example, it said activists showed willingness to commit violence to achieve their political objectives, noting the sledgehammer attack and property destructions. But the assessment also expressed doubt that the group would explicitly encourage attacks on people, a signature of other groups designated as terrorist organizations.

“Any such call for action would constitute a significant escalation of PAG’s strategy and intent,” it said, using an abbreviation for Palestine Action group.

Elsewhere, it cited the group’s playbook, the Palestine Action Underground Manual, as evidence that the group was engaged in terrorism because the book suggests “breaking into your target and damaging the contents inside,” advice that could result in “serious property damage.”

“PAG commits or participates in acts of terrorism,” the document said. “PAG has conducted incidents that have resulted in serious property damage with the aim of progressing its political cause.”

The three episodes the assessment cites as meeting the legal test of “committing acts of terrorism” relate to property damage. All were at Elbit Systems or connected manufacturing sites.

One of the three was a break-in in Glasgow where activists flew flags and set off fireworks and a smoke bomb on the roof of a weapon factory. It was prosecuted as a “breach of the peace,” not a terrorism offense.

The Scottish police later concluded that “the group had been focused on protest activity which has not been close to meeting the statutory definition of terrorism,” according to documents obtained by The Times and first reported by Private Eye, an investigative magazine.

The assessment explained that the group “primarily uses direct action tactics” to advance its cause, a majority of which “would not constitute an act of terrorism.” It said that most of the property damage linked to the group “is typically more minor” and that common tactics included graffiti, petty vandalism and sit-ins.

When the government announced its ban of Palestine Action, the home secretary at the time, Yvette Cooper, cited the Glasgow break-in, saying that the group had caused “caused over £1 million worth of damage to parts essential for submarines.” Evidence submitted by prosecutors in court said the group caused damage estimated at 190,000 pounds, or about $260,000, with the remaining costs attributed to a “loss of revenue due to site closure.”

The intelligence document highlights the broad reach of the terrorism law. The ban “marks a radical departure from what came before” because of its reliance on property destruction, said Alan Greene, a senior counterterrorism researcher at Birmingham Law School.

“There is nothing in this document that suggests that there is more to PAG than what is publicly known,” he added.

Many see the law’s application to Palestine Action as an assault on free speech and as government overreach. The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, called on the British government to reverse the ban, saying it expanded the concept of terrorism “beyond clear boundaries.”

More than 1,400 arrests have been made under the law banning the group, mostly at protests where demonstrators held signs reading: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”

Palestine Action, which was founded in 2020, supports Palestinian sovereignty and the end of sales of British-made weapons to Israel. The group has a significant following but no formal membership structure. After the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel in 2023 and the war that followed, the group ramped up its protests.

The group has damaged facilities linked to military companies, including Elbit Systems. Days after vandals defaced President Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on March 8, Ms. Cooper received a recommendation from security officials to ban the group.

In June, activists affiliated with Palestine Action broke into Britain’s largest air base. They sprayed red paint into aircraft engines and damaged planes with crowbars, exposing porous security at the base and embarrassing the government.

Days after the air base break-in, Ms. Cooper put forward legislation proposing the ban to Parliament. The bill sought to ban not only Palestine Action but also two violent international white-supremacist groups.

Lawmakers had to make a choice. They could not oppose the designation of Palestine Action without also blocking the ban on the other organizations.

In a debate over the legislation, several lawmakers from the governing Labour Party and opposition groups condemned the government for clustering the three groups together. Ellie Chowns, a lawmaker from the Green Party, said it had “clearly been done to make it extremely difficult to vote against the motion.”

Mr. Jarvis, the security minister, insisted there was “no political convenience” in the formulation of the ban and that the government was “seeking to ensure the security of our country.”

On July 5, the government enacted the ban, putting Palestine Action on the same legal footing as around 80 national and international groups that the British government has designated as terrorist organizations. The move had wide-ranging ramifications, criminalizing membership, support, financing and other activities related to the group, such as arranging meetings.

Though Palestine Action dissolved, a separate group, Defend Our Juries, has been campaigning against the ban, and Palestine Action has tried to overturn it in London’s High Court. The government won permission to challenge that effort in a hearing set for Sept. 25.

A protester being carried away by police in Trafalgar Square, central London, on Oct 4.

LONDON – London police arrested hundreds of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration on Oct 4 which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester.

Two people were killed in the attack

Organisers refused requests by the police and government to call off the Oct 4 demonstration, which had been announced before the attack, to protest against the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws.

Calling for calm on X on the morning of Oct 4, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews.”

“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together,” he said.

Police arrested protesters in Trafalgar Square in central London as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes.

As at 1730 GMT (1.30am on Oct 5, Singapore time), police said 442 people had been arrested – about half the number arrested at a similar protest in September.

Crowds of more than 1,000 applauded and cheered those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers.

“I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said protester Angie Zelter.

“We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”

Six people were arrested separately after unfurling a Palestine Action banner on Westminster Bridge outside Parliament.

The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action.

Police said the Oct 4 protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the Oct 2 attack.

Activist group Defend Our Juries, which organised the Oct 4 protest, has condemned the attack on the Jewish community in Manchester and urged police to focus on that, not policing the demonstration.

The Oct 2 attack followed incidents of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic hate in Britain this summer, and pro-Palestinian marchers have taken to the streets to denounce Israel, drawing criticism from some members of the Jewish community.

Jewish and Muslim communities in Britain have expressed fears for their safety.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922

October 1, 2025 (Mainichi Japan)

BRUSSELS (AP) -- Pro-Palestinian protests are shaking major European cities, and calls are growing to ban Israel from sporting and cultural events. European navies have been deployed to protect activists trying to get aid into Gaza -- and a wave of countries have done the once-unthinkable and recognized a Palestinian state.

As outrage over the humanitarian catastrophe grows, more European leaders, sometimes driven by pressure from their populations, have openly condemned Israel's war conduct and sought to push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to agree to a ceasefire and allow in aid.

"There has been a ground-breaking shift in Europe where somewhere over the last year populations have been putting more pressure on their governments, which has helped break taboos at the top over criticism of Israel," said Sanam Vakil, director of the Chatham House think tank's Middle East and North Africa program.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, one of Israel's closest EU allies, said last week that she would support European Union sanctions against Israel. It was her toughest position yet, and followed a nationwide strike in Italy and pro-Palestinian protests from Palermo to Milan.

Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Meloni said: "Israel ended up violating humanitarian norms, causing a massacre among civilians."

Since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched air and ground attacks on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 66,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says women and children make up around half.

The war has also destroyed vast areas of Gaza, killed 289 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, displaced around 90% of Gaza's population, and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including an outbreak of famine in Gaza City.

Pro-Palestinian protests have grown, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which monitors worldwide conflicts. From December to April there were 780 protests across Europe. That has grown to 2,066 in the last five months, an average of at least 15 a day, said researcher Ciro Murillo.

The protests cut across parties and include members of Europe's large Muslim communities, an important voting bloc in countries like France and Germany.

In the past six months there were only 51 pro-Israel protests in Europe, about half of them in Germany. ACLED data showed a steep drop in public support for Israel starting a few months after the war began.

Speaking at the U.N. two days after Meloni, Netanyahu seemed to acknowledge the turn.

"Sure, in the days immediately following Oct. 7, many ... supported Israel. But that support quickly evaporated when Israel did what any self-respecting nation would do in the wake of such a savage attack," he told world leaders.

Israel's deep ties with Europe

With a shared birth in the aftermath of World War II, Israel and the European Union are intricately interwoven.

Almost all Jewish Israelis trace their heritage to either the broader Middle East or the Jewish communities of Europe laid waste to by pogroms in the Russian empire and the genocidal Third Reich of Germany.

"Israel is from Europe, and anyone who fails to admit it or understand it doesn't really understand this country," said Sharon Pardo, a professor at Ben-Gurion University and author of a book on European-Israeli relations, "Uneasy Neighbors."

Strategic practicality drove Israel towards Europe, even if many considered it "a continent of murderers," Pardo said. Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, began building long-standing economic, political and cultural ties with Europe. Today the EU is Israel's top trading partner.

"These were the immediate markets for Israeli agriculture, this was the market for weapons for Israel," Pardo said.

But the embrace by Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, of far-right European parties has antagonized the European political establishment.

"Netanyahu's Israel is an anti-European Union country, a Euro-skeptic country that does its utmost to harm the European integration project," Pardo said.

Criticism of Israel rises as war in Gaza grinds on

The shocking violence of Oct. 7, 2023, ignited an outpouring of support from European leaders.

Ursula von der Leyen, the EU's political chief, visited a still-smoldering kibbutz days later and met with Netanyahu. She pledged EU support for Israel.

But nearly two years later, Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, accused her of "empowering a terrorist organization" with her surprise call for the EU to increase pressure on Israel to halt the war.

Von der Leyen said there's been "a more systematic shift in the last months that is simply unacceptable" in the conflict and that "Europe needs to do more."

She was likely influenced by growing protests and by EU staff critical of her policies, said Lisa Musiol, head of EU Affairs for the International Crisis Group. She pointed to open letters criticizing the EU's Gaza policy signed by more than 2,000 current EU staffers and 390 former European ambassadors and officials.

Von der Leyen proposed increasing EU tariffs on some Israeli goods and sanctioning some Israeli settlers and two members of Netanyahu's Cabinet. She would also sanction 10 Hamas leaders. EU leaders were to discuss the proposals Wednesday in Copenhagen.

Major EU measures require unanimity -- a likely impossibility in the 27-nation bloc -- but some can be passed with a vote weighted by population. That would require Italy or Germany to join nations critical of Israel.

All eyes on Merz and Meloni

Germany's support for Israel is second only to the United States. But Germany's ruling coalition is split on Gaza, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right Christian Democrats supporting Israel and the smaller Social Democrats more critical of the war.

Merz has spoken to Netanyahu about his growing concerns and has curbed arms sales to Israel, but said he is not considering sanctions.

Germany's historical responsibility for the Holocaust has shaped its postwar support for insuring Israel's security and combating antisemitism. Still, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Berlin on Saturday calling for the war's end.

More likely to swing the vote would be Meloni, who has said she supports Italy joining recent moves to recognize a Palestinian state by European neighbors France, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, the United Kingdom and Portugal, as well as Commonwealth nations Canada and Australia.

In contrast to Germany, Italy has a different historical relationship to Israel, said Elisabetta Brighi, a University of Westminster professor. Deeply influenced by the country's strong trade unions and the Vatican, Italy could switch and join European efforts to pressure Israel over Gaza.

"Italy has not translated the trauma of fascism the same way that Germany has," she said.

Italy has joined Spain in sending navy ships to protect a flotilla of boats carrying activists seeking to break Israel's blockade of Gaza after the activists said they were attacked by drones near Greece.

Calls have also grown to ban Israel from some sporting and cultural events, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying after protesters disrupted the Spanish Vuelta cycling race last month that Israel should be excluded until the "barbarity" in Gaza ends. Some countries have also threatened to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest -- hugely popular in Israel and Europe -- if Israel is allowed to compete.

Between 200 and 300 people participated in a demonstration in downtown Boston on Tuesday night after what began as a pro-Palestinian protest quickly turned into a riot.

In total, 13 people were arrested after police say people in the group became violent toward police officers. The agitators also blocked an intersection, according to police.

"When officers attempted to move the group to the sidewalk to allow emergency vehicles to pass, protesters surrounded police cruisers, kicked vehicle doors and resisted dispersal efforts. Several officers were assaulted during this period, including one struck in the face. Protesters also ignited smoke devices and flares, further endangering officers and bystanders," the Boston Police Department said in a statement.

Police said "as violence escalated," more officers were deployed to the area while agitators "continued to resist dispersal."

During the melee, police officers reported that rioters were forcibly removing and damaging their equipment.

"During the disturbance, officers reported equipment being forcibly removed or damaged, including body-worn cameras, radios, bicycles and other duty gear," the agency said.

Boston police made arrests for unlawful assembly, violent resistance and the obstruction of emergency response efforts.

According to Boston.com, the initial protest was organized by local Students for Justice in Palestine chapters, which coincided with the two-year mark of the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas.

The protest was intended to "flood downtown for Palestine."

According to the report, people yelled "F--- you, Nazis" and "BPD is KKK" as they refused to leave the area.

In a statement, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu said that those who engaged in attacks on police will be prosecuted to the "fullest extent of the law."

"We are extremely grateful for the work of the Boston Police in keeping the city safe and in supporting the right to peacefully protest. Boston will not tolerate violence, and we categorically condemn those who came into our community to attack our police officers. The individuals who engaged in these attacks must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," Wu said.

Protesters on Wednesday also showed up to the arraignments of those who were arrested during the riot on Tuesday night, according to the Boston Herald.

Pro-Palestinian protesters repeatedly halted cyclists and clashed with police during the final leg of the Vuelta a Espana cycle race on Sunday evening in a demonstration against Israeli participation.

Images on local TV station RTVE showed protesters overturning metal barriers and occupying the race route at several points as police attempted to push them back. They threw barricades into the middle of the street on Gran Via, one of the city’s main thoroughfares through which the race had been due to pass.

The clashes came hours after the country’s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he admired the pro-Palestinian protesters whose activities along the race route led some riders to threaten to quit the competition last week.

With large demonstrations anticipated, more than 1,000 police officers had been deployed on Sunday as cyclists reached the final stage of the 21-day race in Madrid.

The protests, which have targeted the Israel-Premier Tech team over Israel’s actions in Gaza, have disrupted several stages of the race, which was due to end at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT).”Today marks the end of the Vuelta,” Sanchez told a Socialist party rally in the southern city of Malaga.

“Our respect and recognition for the athletes and our admiration for the Spanish people who are mobilising for just causes like Palestine.”

Israeli forces showed no signs of relenting on their new ground offensive in Gaza City on Monday as world leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and more countries prepared to join the surge of nations recognizing a Palestinian state.

Hundreds of thousands have remained in the city, the territory’s largest and already in ruins from nearly two years of war and struggling with famine. The Israeli military ordered the evacuation on Monday of the Jordanian Hospital, a key health clinic, a Palestinian health official said.

The latest Israeli operation, which started last Tuesday, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire farther out of reach. The Israeli military, which says it wants to “destroy Hamas’ military infrastructure,” hasn’t given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Many have been attempting to relocate from the city, where 1 million people once lived, to the southern Gaza Strip, following Israeli military calls for a full evacuation.

Palestinian Mission to the UK marks recognition of state

About 400 people gathered at the Palestinian Mission to the U.K. on Monday to mark Britain’s recognition of the Palestinian state.A crowd clapped and cheered as the Palestinian flag was raised in front of the building during a ceremony.

Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian head of mission in the U.K., thanked the people of Britain for supporting their cause.“We will always remember how you stood by our sides, on the right side of history,” he said.Zomlot also held up a plaque made for the newly inaugurated embassy, though he didn’t give details about when the mission would formally transition to an embassy.

He also said Sunday that recognition must be followed by action, including sanctioning Israel and reversing the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements.

Coalition of aid groups says 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City since August

Site Management Cluster, whose figures are widely trusted by the UN and humanitarian groups, said its teams counted about 297,597 “movements” from Gaza City toward the south between August 14 and Sept. 20.The organization uses the term “movements” in case the same displaced person moves more than once.

But in reality, field monitoring teams say nearly all movements are people fleeing the city. They monitor the number of people moving during daytime hours through four locations in Gaza, meaning the figure could be an undercount. Israel’s military claims that over 500,000 Palestinians have left the city.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are still sheltering in the city as troops move in.

Mixed feelings among people fleeing Gaza City about recognition of a Palestinian state

Some Palestinians fleeing Gaza City said they see the flurry of recognitions as “a glimmer of hope” and urged other countries to join the move.“ This is a beginning, or a glimmer of hope for the Palestinian people,” said Fawzi Nour al-Deen, a displaced Palestinian, said late on Sunday. “We are a people who deserve to have a state.

”Naser Asaliya, another displaced Palestinian from Gaza City, said it was a “positive” move.“ No matter how simple, anything that supports us, strengthens our resolve in light of this unjust blockade,” he said.

Others downplayed the impact of the recognition in the face of the devastation of the territory. “All of this is worthless,” said Huda Masawabi, a displaced woman. “We just hope to God that someone outside would acknowledge us or even deal with us as mere human beings.”

Italian workers and students join general strike and protest in support of Gaza

Thousands of workers and students across Italy have joined a general strike and demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Italy’s grassroots unions called for the 24-hour strike on Monday, affecting both public and private sectors, including transportation, schools and ports.

The strike caused disruptions nationwide, with delays for trains and limited public transport in cities like Rome and Milan.

More than 20,000 people gathered in front of Rome’s central station to protest the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Unions and student organizations have criticized the Italian and EU governments for their inaction.

France says ties with a Palestinian state will be conditional on Hamas’ release of hostages

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot linked France’s gradual establishment of diplomatic relations with a Palestinian state on the release of hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, following their October. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war. The comments come as French President Emmanuel Macron is to formally recognize a Palestinian state later on Monday at the United Nations.

This is “a symbolic, immediate, political decision that shows France’s commitment to the two-state solution,” Barrot said, speaking on TF1 television on Monday. He added that its “implementation, the establishment of diplomatic relations, will be gradual and under condition of a number of factors on the ground, including the release of hostages.”

Israeli military orders evacuation of a key Gaza City hospital

The Jordanian field hospital in the city’s southwestern neighborhood of Tal al-Hawa received orders to evacuate on Monday morning, according to a senior health official.

The military has already ordered all Palestinians in Gaza City to head south, to central and southern Gaza Strip. It has told aid workers in private messages that all humanitarian sites — except hospitals — must evacuate.

The military didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Dr. Muneer al-Boush, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that the hospital has at least 300 patients, as well as medical staff and family members of the patients.

The order came as residents reported that troops were approaching the facility, with dozens of families trapped in their homes and shelters around the hospital.

A surge in recognitions

Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France was expected to do the same at the General Assembly.

Portugal also joined the group, announcing its recognition later Sunday from New York.

France and Saudi Arabia hope to use this year’s gathering of world leaders and the increasingly horrific war in the Gaza Strip to inject new urgency into the quest for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. The US has blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the General Assembly.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank.

Paris’ famed Eiffel Tower projects both Palestinian and Israeli flags

The two flags and a dove with an olive branch have been projected onto a giant screen on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday evening, ahead of France’s recognition of a Palestinian State.

The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said on Bluesky social media that it was meant to show Paris’ support for French President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative, to be formalized at a United Nations conference later on Monday.“

Paris reaffirms its commitment to peace, which more than ever requires a two-state solution” and expressed “its solidarity towards all Palestinian and Israeli civilian victims,” Hidalgo wrote.

A Paris suburb and others across France raise Palestinian flags

The mayor of Saint-Denis, in Paris’ northern suburbs, raised the Palestinian flag on the town hall on Monday morning as a “testament of solidarity” toward the people in Gaza.

France’s Interior Ministry said at least 21 municipalities across the country have made a similar move, defying a government order not to display of Palestinian flags on town halls in line with the principle of neutrality in public services.

Saint-Denis’ mayor Mathieu Hanotin said that at “this terrible moment that we live through every day in Gaza,” the flag was a “testament to international solidarity in the face of the ongoing massacres.”

Cities such as Nantes and Rennes in western France and several suburban towns around Paris also raised the Palestinian flag, echoing a call launched by Socialist leader Olivier Faure. Faure said France’s recognition of a Palestinian state, alongside other Western nations, was “a major step towards the possibility tomorrow of a peace with two states.”

LONDON – The British government on Sept 25 sought to block the co-founder of pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Action from bringing a legal challenge over the banning of the group under anti-terrorism laws.

Palestine Action has increasingly targeted Israel-linked companies in Britain, often spraying red paint, blocking entrances or damaging equipment. It accuses Britain’s government of complicity in what it says are Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

The group was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July, making it a crime to be a member, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. More than 1,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group.

Huda Ammori, who helped found Palestine Action in 2020, was in July given permission to

challenge the group’s proscription

Britain’s Home Office is asking the British Court of Appeal to overturn that decision and rule that any challenge to proscription should be heard by a specialist tribunal, rather than the High Court.

Palestine Action was proscribed shortly after some of its members

broke into the RAF Brize Norton airbase

The group has particularly focused on Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems, and Britain’s government cited a raid at an Elbit site in 2024 when it decided to proscribe the group.

Israel has repeatedly denied committing abuses in its war in Gaza, which began after Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza on Oct 7, 2023. REUTERS

LONDON - Six people appeared in a London court on Friday charged with some 50 offences for organising support for the proscribed pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action which prosecutors said was an attempt to make its ban unenforceable.

Britain banned Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws in July, making it a crime to be a member with a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.

Since then, a number of protests have been held in support of the group, which prosecutor Peter Ratcliff told London's Old Bailey court the six defendants - three men and three women - had played a role in organising.

Ratcliff said 13 meetings had been held online since proscription where the defendants had encouraged and arranged "mass civil disobedience" at which attendees deliberately committed offences "essentially to make proscription unenforceable".

So far 1,500 people had been arrested for offences relating to the ban, Ratcliff said.

Tim Crosland, 55, David Nixon, 39, Dawn Manners, 61, Gwen Harrison, 48, Melanie Griffith, 62, and Patrick Friend, 26, are accused of numerous counts of arranging or addressing a meeting in support of a proscribed group.

Throughout Friday's hearing, Nixon stood with his eyes closed, holding a small notice which read "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action".

The group, which had carried out protests against Israel-linked companies in Britain, was proscribed shortly after some of its members broke into the RAF Brize Norton air base and damaged two planes in June, for which four members have been charged.

Its co-founder is currently bringing a legal challenge against that ban. Prosecutor Ratcliff said London's High Court was expected to make a decision on this by the end of the year.

The six are due to enter a plea to the charges at a hearing in January, with a four-week trial provisionally listed for June next year. REUTERS
