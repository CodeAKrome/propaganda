Text: President Donald Trump’s meeting with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the White House on Tuesday left a few major issues unresolved, including Trump’s desire for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and MBS’s hopes of acquiring American nuclear energy technology.

MBS told reporters after the meeting that he and Trump had a “healthy discussion” about the Abraham Accords and Trump agreed it was a “good talk,” but the Saudi leader signaled no actual change in his position.

“We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of two-state solution. We’re going to work on that, to be sure that we can prepare the right situation as soon as possible,” he said.

“We want peace for the Israelis. We want peace for the Palestinians,” he said. “We want them to coexist peacefully in the region, and we will do our best to reach that date.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been adamant that the Palestinians will not be given a state after the aggression of October 7, 2023, and recent events have strongly suggested the Netanyahu government would not survive taking a step down the “path of a two-state solution,” that MBS discussed.

The Israeli government became embroiled in a political crisis last weekend after the United States backed a U.N. resolution that very tentatively suggested a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” might exist, provided the Palestinian Authority implemented some ambitious political reforms.

“Our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed. Gaza will be demilitarized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone,” Netanyahu said in response on Sunday, venting his frustration with right-wing Israeli leaders who threatened to collapse his government immediately unless he firmly rebuked Palestinian statehood.

The Abraham Accords have four signatories to date, namely the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. Saudi Arabia does not appear to be in a hurry to become the fifth, no matter how warmly the crown prince speaks of the idea. The Trump administration was evidently hoping Syria might become the fifth during President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House last week, but that did not happen, either.

The Economist noted on Tuesday that the Abraham Accords have proven to be quite durable – there was some tension during the Gaza war, but none of the existing members withdrew – so MBS knows he would be making a major commitment by signing on. There is considerable anecdotal evidence to suggest the Saudis really are interested in joining, but they feel it would be impossible without collecting Palestinian statehood as the price of admission.

Trump was equally noncommittal on the longstanding Saudi desire to obtain American nuclear energy technology.

“I could see that happening. It’s not urgent,” he said when a reporter asked about the prospect of such a deal.

The Saudis might see a nuclear deal as more urgent than Trump, given that they have been working on it since the Obama administration. Every American administration says it wants to make the deal happen, but it never does.

The Saudis are keenly interested in civilian nuclear power, and the U.S. government would very much like to see American companies building those reactors. Saudi Arabia has uranium to sell, and the U.S. wants to buy it and enrich it.

Any U.S. civilian nuclear deal would most likely include a promise that the Saudis would not enrich their own uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel, similar to the commitment made by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) when it opened the Barakah nuclear power plant, the first in the Arab world.

If the Saudis end up doing business with Russia or China on nuclear power, there might not be any guarantee of refraining from enrichment – which is the key capability for transitioning from civilian nuclear power to nuclear weapons.

The long-gestating nuclear deal is bound up in the Abraham Accords debate, as both the Biden and Trump administrations wanted Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel as the price for obtaining nuclear power technology, and the Saudis will not take that step until Palestinian statehood is addressed to their satisfaction.

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance


What’s the ongoing story: US President Donald Trump received Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday, as the two leaders looked to strengthen security ties, expand business cooperation and discuss the future of US-Saudi relations.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What are the features of F-35 fighter jets?

— What is Saudi Vision 2030?

— What is Abraham Accord?

— Has Saudi joined the Abraham Accord?

— What is the issue around the killing of Jamal Khashoggi?

— What are the areas of cooperation and conflict between Saudi and the USA?

— What is Trump’s Gaza plan?

— What is the significance of a stable Middle East for India?

— A Saudi-Israel normalisation and an expanded Abraham Accords could herald a different political architecture for the Middle East. What do you understand from this statement?


— The visit is the crown prince’s first to the White House in more than seven years.





— Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MbS) visit to Washington this week marks an inflexion point in the evolution of US-Saudi relations and raises hopes for a radical transformation of the Middle East.

— For MbS, the visit is also about securing valuable American support for his own looming succession. King Salman, now 89, is frail and has long delegated day-to-day governance to his son.



— In a turbulent region, MbS also seeks solid security assurances from Washington. With the US Senate opposed to a formal defence treaty, Riyadh is pursuing an intergovernmental agreement with the Trump administration.






Do You Know:

— Abraham Accords are a series of agreements signed in September 2020 to normalise relationship between Israel and other Arab nations.

What’s the ongoing story: Ending the suspense over India’s next set of climate action plan, called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs in climate jargon, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said the country’s NDCs for the year 2035 will be finalised and released before the year-end deadline.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What are NDCs?

— What is BTR?

— What is the difference between NDCs and BTR?

— What are the main features of the Paris Agreement?

— What is the purpose of NDCs target?

— What is the status of Greenhouse gas emission from various countries?

— What are the initiatives taken by India to reduce greenhouse emissions?

— India’s NDC target (for 2030 has been) achieved five years ahead of schedule. What were the targets?

— Know about International Solar Alliance, Global Biofuel Alliance, Nuclear mission and green hydrogen mission


— Yadav was making a national statement at the ongoing COP30 climate conference here. He said India had already achieved the targets it had set in its previous NDCs well ahead of schedule, setting an example for developed countries to follow.

— Yadav said along with its 2035 NDCs, India would also release its first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), as mandated under the Paris Agreement. BTRs are part of reporting mechanism instituted under the Paris Agreement, though which countries are supposed to periodically provide information about their greenhouse gas emissions inventory…

— NDCs, on the other hand, are climate action plans that outline efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. Countries are required to update them every five years with progressively higher targets. India’s last NDC, for the period 2030, was announced in 2022 and the latest NDC is to be announced for the year 2035.

— “We shall be declaring our revised NDCs for 2035 and also the first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, by the end of the year,” Yadav said.

— There was a lot of expectation that India, the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, would release its 2035 NDC at the COP30 event, but Yadav said there was still some time, and India would announce the plan after getting the clearance of the Union Cabinet.

— The minister also stated that climate and energy sustainability initiatives adopted by India such as the International Solar Alliance and Global Biofuel Alliance have become global platforms for affordable and clean energy.

— He said that India’s newly launched nuclear mission and green hydrogen mission have also accelerated India’s journey towards reaching its net zero target by 2070. Net zero is a situation in which a country’s total emissions are balanced by carbon absorption or removals from the atmosphere. India has said it will achieve this status by 2070.

— “India’s non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity, currently around 256 Giga Watt (GW), accounts for more than half of its total electric store capacity (500 GW).

— Our NDC target (for 2030 has been) achieved five years ahead of schedule. India has demonstrated successfully that development and environmental stewardship can advance in tandem. India’s emission intensity has declined by over 36 per cent since 2005,” Yadav said in his speech.

Do You Know:

— The analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief, a UK-based climate-focussed publication, shows that the CO2 emissions from India’s electricity sector between January and June this year dropped 1 per cent compared to the first half of 2024.

— This is significant because the electricity sector is the largest contributor to India’s greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for almost 40 per cent of the country’s annual emissions. India’s emissions, the third largest in the world, have been rising steadily over the years, in sync with its expanding economy, and this is the first time that a drop has been witnessed even at the sectoral level.

— India is targeting 500 GW of installed non-fossil electricity capacity by 2030, of which 252 GW has already been achieved. Projects already in the pipeline, if executed before 2030, were enough to take the installed capacity to 482 GW, the analysis said.

Mains Examination: General Studies-III: Government Budgeting

What’s the ongoing story: India’s headline inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has been below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4 per cent for nine months in a row and fell to a record low of just 0.25 per cent in October.

Key Points to Ponder:


— How is CPI inflation calculated?

— What is the role and function of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)?

— How is inflation calculated in India?

— What happens when there is a rise in inflation?

— What is the base effect?

— What is the basket of goods in CPI?

— Is gold included in the basket of goods of CPI?

— What is the proposed new base year for CPI?


— And whether this will lead to the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cutting the policy repo rate further in December or February 2026 will depend a lot on how India’s interest rate-setters interpret the underlying inflation data – for there is plenty that explains how inflation has fallen so low and could have been even lower.

— First, there is obviously the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) cuts that came into effect on September 22. Economists estimate companies are yet to pass on the full benefit of the tax cut to consumers, and this will be reflected in the inflation data for November that will be released on December 12. Then there is the base effect, which was highly favourable not just in October but has been for much of 2025.

— According to calculations by The Indian Express, the favourable base effect in October was 133 bps – the joint second-strongest in 15 months. What this means is that headline retail inflation was 133 bps lower last month from September only because of how consumer prices moved in October 2024 – and they had moved up very sharply.

— Inflation is the percentage change in prices in a month compared to the same month last year. As such, the year-ago price is the denominator to calculate prices this year. If the prices last year were high, then that means the denominator is high – which exerts a downward force on the inflation rate this year.

— The opposite holds true when prices are either stable or declining in the year-ago period: the base effect is unfavourable and exerts upward pressure on the inflation rate.

— But this is the overall base effect – and the overall effect depends heavily on the base effect of the food index, which makes up 39 per cent of the CPI. For the Consumer Food Price Index, the favourable base effect was an even larger 256 bps in October.

— At present, CPI inflation is calculated by looking at price changes for 299 items; two of these items are gold and silver. Why? Because the consumption basket of households, which is what the CPI reflects, includes gold and silver.

Do You Know:

— Inflation refers to the rate at which the general price level for goods and services increases over a period of time, causing a decrease in purchasing power of money or real income. In other words, as inflation rises, each unit of currency can buy fewer goods and services than before.

— Rising inflation affects the financial well-being of households, especially those with lower incomes or fixed incomes. As the cost of goods and services increases, it reduces the quantity of goods and services that can be purchased with the same nominal income, thereby affecting households’ cost of living.

What’s the ongoing story: A new report launched at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Conservation Congress, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, last month, highlighted the growing threat to the dugong population in India.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is the conservation status of dugong?

— Where are dugongs found?

— What is the significance of dugong for the marine ecosystem?

— What are the threats faced by dugong?

— Human activities and degradation of coastal habitats are the primary drivers of decline in the dugong population currently. How to address this?

— What are the steps taken by India to conserve dugong populations?

— What is the IUCN World Conservation Congress?


— In the South Asian region, dugongs, also known as sea cows, are primarily found in the Gulf of Kutch, the Gulf of Mannar–Palk Bay region (located between India and Sri Lanka), and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

— The report, ‘A global assessment of dugong status and conservation needs’, said that the marine mammal’s long-term survival in the Gulf of Kutch and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was “highly uncertain” and “challenging” respectively. Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Mannar-Palk Bay, its population appears to be “much lower” than in the recent past.

— Currently, the IUCN, which compiles the official Red List of endangered species, lists sea cows as a species vulnerable to extinction. In India, they are listed under Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which grants the species the highest legal protection against hunting and trade.

— Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are a marine mammal, which are believed to have inspired ancient seafaring tales of mermaids due to their gentle — seemingly benign — disposition.

— The mammals are exclusively herbivorous, and seagrass meadows are their main source of food — the reason why they are also called sea cows.

— Dugongs play a crucial role in maintaining healthy seagrass ecosystems. For instance, when they graze seagrass, the leaves are pruned and old shoots are uprooted.

— Also, while feeding on seagrass, dugongs help release nutrients from the sediment, which are consumed by other marine species, especially commercially important fish, shellfish, and numerous invertebrates such as sea cucumbers.

— Human activities and degradation of coastal habitats are the primary drivers of decline in the dugong population currently. For instance, a majority of sea cows die due to accidental entanglement in fish nets.

— Sivakumar said, “High turbidity, pollution and fishing are the threats to dugongs in the Gulf of Kutch. Fisheries bycatch and pollution are the major threats in Tamil Nadu. In the Andamans, fisheries-related mortality is higher.”

— A recent study, ‘Toxic traces: First insights into metals and metalloids in dugongs (Dugong dugon) from India’, published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, found five toxic elements — arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead — in tissues of various organs from 46 stranded dugongs in India.

— Over the years, the Centre and state governments have taken several steps to help conserve the dugong population in the country. For instance, the MoEFCC in 2010 constituted a ‘Task Force for Conservation of Dugongs’ to examine the issues related to the conservation of sea cows.

— Subsequently, a national dugong recovery programme was launched in partnership with the governments of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Do You Know:

— Recently, the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2025 has adopted a motion to recognise India’s first dugong conservation reserve in Tamil Nadu’s Palk Bay as a global model for marine biodiversity conservation.

— The IUCN World Conservation Congress took place in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, from 9 to 15 October 2025.


— The IUCN is a global organization comprising 160 member countries and hundreds of civil society groups that work together towards environmental and biodiversity protection.

What’s the ongoing story: At least nine people were killed and 29 others were injured in a powerful explosion inside the Nowgam police station in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. The explosives had been seized as part of the probe into the Red Fort blast and the terror module linked to it. The Jammu and Kashmir Police said the blast was accidental, triggered during a forensic sampling procedure.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is an Improvised Explosive Device?

— What are the roles and responsibilities of PESO?

— What happens when Sodium and Phosphorus are left exposed in open air?

— Which explosives were used in the Red Fort blast?

— What is ricin poison?


— First of all, during any raid or seizure, if the recovered material appears to be an explosive or an IED (Improvised Explosive Device), the enforcement agency must immediately have it examined by the Bomb Detection Team (BDT) and the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) available in the district concerned.

— They can also inform the Controller of Explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) for the destruction process.

— The first instruction is to keep the material away from people and store it in an isolated location, without electricity or any other source of ignition.

— Storing such large quantities of explosives at police stations or in any residential installation should be avoided unless the location has been specifically designated for that purpose.

— Some explosives, or the chemicals used in them, can catch fire immediately if left exposed to open air. For example, sodium is not an explosive, but if it is kept in the open air, it will ignite. Similarly, phosphorus—which is used in some hand grenades—must be kept in water. Therefore, such materials need to be attended to immediately.

— The officer in charge of that particular raid should immediately move the material to a properly isolated area. An FIR should be registered without delay, and the matter should be referred to the Judicial Magistrate of the area, who will grant permission for its immediate destruction.

— While these procedures are underway, the explosives must be stored in licensed explosive magazines or in an open, secure location with proper guarding and monitoring.

— An explosive van may not be available to every district police force, even though it is a very important component in handling explosives. These vans are specially constructed trucks or containers, typically covered with aluminium sheets, with the interior lined with wood.

Do You Know:

— PESO: With an overall objective of ensuring safety and security of public and property from fire and explosion, the Organisation as a statutory authority is entrusted with the administration of Explosives Act, 1884, Petroleum Act, 1934; Inflammable Substances Act, 1952 and the following Rules framed under these Acts.

What’s the ongoing story: As part of efforts to diversify the transportation of commodities via rail to meet new demands, Minister for Railways Ashwini Vaishnaw on Tuesday launched a new policy to facilitate the movement of bulk cement, along with a new rate.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is the Gati Shakti Multi-Modal Cargo Terminal Policy?

— What is the role of railways in freight diversification?

— What are the government initiatives to ease the logistics sector in India?

— What is the role of the logistics sector in supporting India’s vision of Vikshit Bharat?

— How the shift of freight from road to rail is going to impact India’s sustainable development and climate goals?



— Vaishnaw said that the policy will ensure the supply of bulk cement from plants to terminals near consumption centres in specialised wagons, which will be cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

— The Railways will also facilitate the setting up of bulk cement terminals across the country under its Bulk Cement Terminal policy, the Minister said.


— He further said that with the implementation of the Gati Shakti Multi-Modal Cargo Terminal Policy, the construction of the terminal or railway sidings has become easy.

— Almost 17 per cent of the total cement transported in a year moves via the Railways. During FY25, a total of 87 million tonnes (MT) of cement was transported via the Railways.



Do You Know:

— National Logistics Portal-Marine: It was launched on 27th March 2023 to provide a one-stop platform to connect all the stakeholders of the logistics community using IT. It aims to improve efficiency and transparency by reducing costs and time delays and achieving easier, faster, and more competitive offerings of services, to promote the growth of the logistics sector and thereby improve trade.

— According to the latest World bank’s Logistics Performance Index, India has climbed six places on the LPI 2023, now ranking 38th in the 139 countries index. India was ranked 44th on the index in 2018 and has now climbed to 38th in the 2023 listing. India’s performance has drastically improved from 2014, when it was ranked 54th on the LPI.

— Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 launched the “PM GatiShakti — National Master Plan” for infrastructure development aimed at boosting multimodal connectivity and driving down logistics costs.

— PM GatiShakti is a digital platform that connects 16 ministries — including Roads and Highways, Railways, Shipping, Petroleum and Gas, Power, Telecom, Shipping, and Aviation — with a view to ensuring holistic planning and execution of infrastructure projects.

Text: A dramatic ruling is expected within the next day from retired judge David Cheshin, who has been serving as arbitrator in the long-running dispute surrounding the Ponovezh (also spelled Ponovitz) Yeshiva in Bnei Brak - one of the oldest and most well-known internal conflicts in the Haredi world.

Haredi commentator Yisrael Cohen outlined the roots of the dispute in a conversation with Israel National News - Arutz Sheva, describing the historic stature of the institution. “This is the Oxford of the yeshiva world,” he said. Following the Holocaust, Rabbi Yosef Kahaneman arrived in Israel with a vision to rebuild a great yeshiva bearing the name of the town in which he had once served as rabbi. “People pitied him and didn’t believe he could do it, but he purchased lands in Bnei Brak and built a massive Beit Midrash for that era.”

Rabbi Kahaneman also established dormitories for students, housing for Rabbis, teachers and lecturers, and founded orphanages for boys and girls from across the Jewish world - all funded through donations he raised abroad. What began with a small group of students grew rapidly, and over the years leading senior Rabbis were appointed, including Rabbi Shmuel Rozovsky, Rabbi Dovid Kovarsky, and Rabbi Shach, who ultimately became the leading figure of the Lithuanian Torah world.

After Rabbi Kahaneman’s passing, the yeshiva was led by his son, Rabbi Avraham Kahaneman. Upon his own passing, a fierce conflict erupted between his son, Rabbi Eliezer Kahaneman, and his son-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Markovitz, over both financial ownership and authority within the yeshiva.

“The late rabbi left two children - Rabbi Eliezer, and Rebbetzin Tzipora, who married Rabbi Markovitz,” Cohen explained. Disagreements over inheritance soon escalated into a struggle over leadership. Rabbi Markovitz claimed that Rabbi Shach had intended for him to assume the role of rosh yeshiva, in addition to his familial standing. Rabbi Kahaneman, meanwhile, stated he was prepared to forgo material ownership but insisted that he retained the right to appoint the yeshiva’s leadership, as had other yeshiva leaders aligned with him in previous years.

Over time, the dispute drew in senior rabbinic leaders across the Haredi sector, dividing the yeshiva into two rival camps - the “Shonim” and the “Machablim.” Each faction now operates its own administrative structure, with separate rabbinic staff, student rosters, and even split dormitories and study areas. Prayers and public events are held separately, and any joint framework has long since collapsed.

According to Cohen, tensions at times spilled into physical confrontations, and for roughly two decades the institution has functioned as what he termed “two yeshivot under one roof.” Students study the same Talmud tractate and share the dining hall, but the faculty, lecturers, supervisors, and dormitory divisions remain completely separate. Even on Shabbat and holidays, the split is seen clearly: the Shonim and their rabbis pray in the “Ohel Kedoshim” hall established by Rabbi Kahaneman, while the other camp maintains its own prayer groups.

Cohen noted that each new academic year often saw renewed clashes, as both sides accepted hundreds of new students and fought over beds, rooms, and seating in the Beit Midrash - “causing a great desecratio of G-d's name,” he said.

Given the immense material and spiritual value of the property and in an attempt to prevent further deterioration, both sides eventually agreed to enter arbitration before Judge Cheshin. His forthcoming ruling is expected to determine how authority and ownership - both financial and spiritual - will be divided.

Addressing the question of how a community that generally avoids civil courts came to accept such a process, Cohen stressed that this is arbitration, not a court proceeding. “That makes it easier for the sides to accept the decision. There is also hope that someone from outside will see the full picture more clearly and deliver a better outcome.”

The ruling is expected to outline the future distribution of responsibilities and assets in the yeshiva, much of which stands on land acquired decades ago by Rabbi Kahaneman. Whether the decision will be accepted by both camps remains uncertain.

Despite the split, Cohen emphasized that the yeshiva’s reputation remains untouched. “The Ponovezh name hasn’t suffered. One would expect such a dispute to weaken the yeshiva, but it didn’t happen - the best students still sought admission.”

Although the conflict generated headlines over the years, Cohen said the individuals involved never viewed their actions as deliberate provocation. “Each side believes it is fighting for truth, for a religious principle that cannot be compromised.”

Yet even after moments of public tension, he noted, it was common to see members of both camps continuing their routine calmly side-by-side in the Beit Midrash.

Text: The IDF military censor permitted publication this morning (Wednesday) that the intelligence officer of the Southern Command during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 was Lt. Col. Ariel Levovsky.

Until now his name was banned from publication due to his status as an intelligence officer, but after his release from the IDF the restriction was lifted.

Lt. Col. Levovsky served as the Southern Command intelligence officer in the period before the attack. He was among the officers who were exposed to the 'Wall of Jericho' plan, the Hamas codename for a large invasion of Israel. He was among the decision-makers who regarded the information as an exercise or a move that did not constitute a threat.

Months after the outbreak of the war, Levovsky was dismissed from his position due to an improper intimate relationship he had with a female officer in the command's intelligence branch.

The relationship took place after the start of the fighting, and the dismissal was carried out because of that relationship - not for his role in the intelligence failure.

After his dismissal, the chief of staff at the time, Herzi Halevi, approved Levovsky's transfer on loan to the National Cyber Directorate in order to accrue pension rights. He served in that position until his discharge from the IDF recently.

The decision not to remove the officer from the army sparked extensive criticism among officers in the IDF and among bereaved families.

The Gaza Division intelligence officer at that time continues to serve as an officer in the Intelligence Directorate. After the events he was placed in a post at the Chief Intelligence Officer's command, and his name is still prohibited from publication.

Text: President Donald Trump is set to fete Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is set to fete Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday when the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia makes his first White House visit since the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.

The U.S.-Saudi relationship had been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom, that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed the agents to carry out.

But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump has tightened his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Prince Mohammed, for his part, denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident.

Khashoggi will likely be an afterthought as the two leaders unveil billions of dollars in deals and huddle with aides to discuss the tricky path ahead in a volatile Middle East. They'll end their day with an evening White House soiree, organized by first lady Melania Trump, to honor the prince.

“They have been a great ally,” Trump said of the Saudis on the eve of the visit.

Ahead of Prince Mohammed's arrival, Trump announced he has agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system.

Trump's announcement is also surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel’s qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan.

But the unexpected move comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel.

The president in his first term had helped forge commercial and diplomatic ties between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates through an effort dubbed the Abraham Accords.

Trump sees expansion of the accords as essential to his broader efforts to build stability in the Middle East after the two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

And getting Saudi Arabia — the largest Arab economy and the birthplace of Islam — to sign on would create an enormous domino effect, he argues. The president in recent weeks has even predicted that once Saudi Arabia signs on to the accords, “everybody” in the Arab world “goes in.”

But the Saudis have maintained that a clear path toward Palestinian statehood must first be established before normalizing relations with Israel can be considered. The Israelis, meanwhile, remain steadfastly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.

The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.

The leaders certainly will have plenty to talk about including maintaining the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, mutual concerns about Iran’s malign behavior, and a brutal civil war in Sudan.

And the Saudis are looking to receive formal assurances from Trump defining the scope of U.S. military protection for the kingdom, even though anything not ratified by Congress can be undone by the next president.

Prince Mohammed, 40, who has stayed away from the West after the Khashoggi killing, is also looking to reestablish his position as a global player and a leader determined to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in sectors like mining, technology and tourism.

To that end, Saudi Arabia is expected to announce a multi-billion dollar investment in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure, and the two countries will lay out details about new cooperation in the civil nuclear energy sector, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly ahead of the formal announcement.

“I think the challenge for us as Americans is to try to convince someone like MBS that the trajectory of Saudi Arabia ought to look more like South Korea than, say, China,” said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, speaking at a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace event on Monday. “That, ultimately, political repression of political dissent is not good for business. It’s not good for attracting foreign direct investment, it’s not good for your image if you’re a tourism destination.”

But this week's warm embrace by Trump might provide a counterfactual to that argument for the crown prince.

In addition to White House pomp, the two nations are also planning an investment summit at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday that will include the heads of Salesforce, Qualcomm, Pfizer, the Cleveland Clinic, Chevron and Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s national oil and natural gas company, where even more deals with the Saudis could be announced.

Text: As Johannesburg prepares to host Africa's first ever G20 summit, South Africa aims to showcase its diplomatic and economic potential despite the US boycott.

In South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg, preparations for hosting the world's biggest economic players at the annual G20 (Group of 20) summit have been underway for weeks.

"The preparations were actually perfect. Anything else will be overkill," Siphamandla Zondi, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Johannesburg, told DW following a workshop on the G20 summit, which takes place on November 22–23.

Lindelani Mkhaliphi, a young South African who also took part in the workshop, said: "It does make me feel proud. We're also representing the entirety of Africa."

The first G20 summit to be held on African soil is a big moment for South Africa, which is trying to straddle its role as a BRICS member, while remaining a valued trade partner for Western democracies.

But for Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi, president and CEO of the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), South Africa's focus on solidarity, equality, and sustainability has been refreshing.

"It comes at a time when the world is starting to recognize that Africa is central to solving a lot of the global challenges," Owusu-Gyamfi told DW, adding that "global growth and stability depend on whether the African continent's trajectory is good or bad."

She points to Africa's fast growing, young population, its increasing share of the global workforce, and  sovereignty over a "significant percentage of the critical minerals that we need for green growth."

The United States will assume the G20 rotating presidency on December 1, but is boycotting the G20 summit in Johannesburg.

Washington's relationship with South Africa has soured: First came crippling aid cuts through USAID in February, which affected thousands of vulnerable South Africans. Then Pretoria was singled out for high tariffs.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has asserted, without tangible evidence, that a genocide targeting white people is occurring in South Africa.


Washington has also castigated Pretoria for its ongoing case at the International Court of Justice against Israel over its actions in the Gaza Strip.

But according to Menzi Ndhlovu, a political risk analyst at Signal Risk, skipping the G20 serves another function.

"This is about the delegitimization of South Africa, its leadership status, and its belonging in the upper echelons of the global power structures," he said.

"The US, or Republicans rather, see South Africa as a country case of DEI [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion]," Ndhlovu told DW. "And the Republicans are opposed to DEI in America. So to make an example in the international arena, they have flagged South Africa."

In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused South Africa of "using the G20 to promote 'solidarity, equality, & sustainability.' In other words: DEI and climate change," which he said were "anti-Americanisms."

But snubbing an organization representing around 85% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP),60% of the world's population, and over 75% of global trade is still an issue. The G20 consists of the world's 19 biggest economies plus the European Union (EU) and African Union (AU), and senior officials are expected to attend despite the US absence.

Referring to Trump's claims of genocide in South Africa, analyst Ndhlovu said: "A lot of major powers are looking past some of the theatrics, and they don't want any part of it because they see the value in partnering with what still is Africa's largest and most influential economy."

Ndhlovu acknowledges the US boycott is a major obstacle because of its economic clout and influence on global institutions, but suggests there are ways around this for South Africa.

"The response from South Africa to Trump's non-attendance was very stately," Ndhlovu told DW. "The next step is actually more important, and that is finding resolutions that can work in the absence of the US and where there is consensus."

"Global cooperation does not revolve around a single country," noted economist Owusu-Gyamfi.

"South Africa has used this G20 presidency to highlight the fact that solving current global challenges, be it debt reform, climate financing, trade, is a collective action by the G20 and beyond."

The problems for South Africa, and President Cyril Ramaphosa's government, are considerable: Corruption scandals, high crime rates, and a stagnating economy battling staggering unemployment. Still, Ndhlovu and others see the G20 as a chance for South Africa to "put on a good show."

"As Africans, there is a tendency to feel like all of this does not affect us, that we perceive this as European," Nghede Adams, a Nigerian scholar at the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told DW.

"But, here in South Africa, it is home, an opportunity for us to connect."

Ugandan Martha Tukahirwa of the Fight Inequality Alliance, who will be on the sidelines of the G20, told DW: "The global economy is not only in a state of just mere faltering, but we're in a moment where there is a lot of extractivism. It's exclusionary, and highly unstable."

She believes the summit is a "political moment" because previously, important multilateral spaces were led by representatives from other continents.

"We need to use the space to really amplify our demands," she said.

Aside from the apparent US snub, the boldest aims of South Africa's leadership may also be its biggest challenges.

"In sub-Saharan Africa, our elders hold dearly to the principles of equity, of unity in a crisis," Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi said.

"So I'm really proud Soupluth Africa held strong onto those. They've put debt sustainability for low-income countries at the heart of the agenda, with countries spending an average of 17% of their revenues on debt repayment right now."

She describes this as a first, and believes the G20's legacy must translate into real benefits for Africa's economic growth.

"Africa has to transform its economies from a dependence on exporting raw materials to value addition that can create jobs for its people," political economist Owusu-Gyamfi told DW.

"It must have access to the right types of finance when it is needed. South Africa's focus on the cost of capital is an excellent example of why the G20 happening on African soil is good for Africa."

Analyst Ndhlovu added that picking the right themes, like debt restructuring, can make the G20 a success for South Africa.

"Critical minerals, that is also good low-hanging fruit," he said.

"The US might even decide to get involved because it's so keenly interested in critical minerals. And maybe we might have to get to a situation where we accept that the G20 is a starting point and it turns into a 'plurilateral' platform, not necessarily a multilateral platform."

Away from the diplomacy, Professor Siphamandla Zondi hopes the G20's legacy will be far reaching, including on the host city, Johannesburg.

"We're honorable people," he told DW. "We didn't do it because we're trying to create a facade in front of the G20."

Text: TEHRAN, Nov. 19 (MNA) – Iran's UN Envoy says that the US resolution on Gaza must not be interpreted or implemented in a manner that violates or undermines the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.

According to Mehr News Agency,  Iranian Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) Amir Saeed Iravani made the remarks addressing the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) session of the UN.

The full text Ambassador Iravani's speech is as follows,

In the Name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful

Mr. Chair,

At the outset, I would like to extend our appreciation to the Chair of the Special Committee and to the Assistant Secretary General for their presentations on the reports concerning the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) and the Occupied Syrian Golan. In addition to continued occupational actions and policies, including the expansion of illegal settlements, it is deeply regrettable that credible reports have documented widespread torture and sexual violence against Palestinians, while the humanitarian toll has been catastrophic, with nearly 70,000 civilians—predominantly women and children—having been killed by the Israeli regime.

It is unacceptable that this regime has revealed its malign and non-peaceful nature by systematically eroding the legitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations. Israel has deliberately disregarded successive advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice, which affirm its obligation to cease its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, halt all settlement activities, and evacuate settlers. Most recently, Israeli authorities openly rejected the ICJ’s advisory opinion, dismissing it as biased and illegitimate, while the Court clearly documented Israel’s breaches of international law—including the prohibition of starvation as a method of warfare—and ordered it to facilitate humanitarian relief in Gaza through the United Nations and its agencies. Iran strongly condemns these misleading assertions by Israeli authorities against the UN and its main bodies, and considers them a flagrant defiance of international law and the authority of the United Nations.

Mr. Chair, Distinguished Delegates,

The unabated expansion of illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory remains a matter of grave concerns. This year alone, according to official announcements by the authorities of the Israeli occupying regime, approximately 30,000 additional settlement units are planned, further deepening and widening the already extensive network of unlawful settlements. Such actions, compounded by recent Israeli Knesset's approval of legislation aimed at annexing the occupied West Bank and imposing alleged Israeli sovereignty over it, must be firmly rejected by the international community.

We also express our profound concern over the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the extensive destruction of its infrastructures, including schools, hospitals, and residential areas. These atrocities, compounded by weaponizing starvation as a method of warfare, not only intensify human suffering but also undermine the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right of return and to live in dignity in their homeland.

The General Assembly is deeply alarmed by reports indicating that, in the past month alone, hundreds of ceasefire violations have occurred in Gaza and more than 270 Palestinians have been killed, with many more injured. This situation is profoundly regrettable, particularly as civilians—including children—who had placed their hopes in the ceasefire have instead been subjected to renewed bombardments and violence by Israeli forces as well as its armed settlers. Such actions reflect the conduct of a non-compliant actor, which acts in bad faith and consistently fails to honor its commitments.

Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran is steadfast in its support of any credible initiative aimed at ending the genocide in Gaza, ensuring the complete withdrawal of occupying forces, establishing a permanent ceasefire, facilitating the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, and restoring the inalienable and fundamental rights of the Palestinian people; however, we stress that any plan concerning Gaza or other parts of the Palestinian territory that fails to incorporate or reflect the views and aspirations of all Palestinian people, are pursued as part of a broader colonial strategy and blatantly disregard the rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them, the right to self-determination. These actions constitute a clear manifestation of colonialism, persisting despite repeated calls from the international community for its cessation.

Mr. Chair,

Distinguished Delegates,

In regards to the adoption of the U.S. draft resolution yesterday, we noted the concerns expressed by Security Council members, over the mechanisms contained in the Resolution, which seek to circumvent the responsibilities of the United Nations and the Security Council itself. Nevertheless, many members, while voicing these concerns, voted in favor of the resolution with the immediate and primary objective of halting the bloodshed and genocide in Gaza, protecting the lives of Palestinian civilians—including women and children—ensuring a durable ceasefire, facilitating broad humanitarian assistance, and guaranteeing the full withdrawal of Israeli occupying forces.

The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates that this resolution and its mechanisms must not be interpreted or implemented in a manner that violates or undermines the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Gaza is an integral part of Palestinian territory, and its unity and territorial integrity must be fully preserved. It must be administered under a Palestinian transitional committee. As stressed by many Council members, no annexation, occupation, or forced displacement should be permitted or justified under this new resolution. Humanitarian aid must flow freely and be distributed throughout Gaza through UN agencies, without interference.

My delegation believes that ending the war against the people of Gaza, however vital, does not absolve member states or competent international bodies of their shared legal, moral, and humanitarian obligations to ensure justice and accountability. True justice requires full accountability. The perpetrators and masterminds of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in Gaza must be prosecuted, and the decades-long culture of impunity surrounding the Israeli regime must finally end.

Last but not least, Mr. Chair, with regard to the occupied territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, Iran strongly condemns the ongoing illegal Israeli presence, military actions, and further invasions, which have resulted in the death and injury of Syrian citizens as well as the destruction of vital infrastructure. In line with relevant UN resolutions, we reiterate that Israel’s attempt to impose its laws, jurisdiction, and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and has no validity under international law.

I thank you, Mr. Chair.

A group of 'Palestine Action' protesters are accused of wreaking havoc while armed with fireworks and an axe

A pro-Gaza activist "fractured a policewoman's spine in a sledgehammer ambush" while allegedly supporting Palestine Action, a court has heard.

Samuel Corner, 23, is alleged to have been among a group of Palestine Action protesters who broke into Elbit Systems UK, an Israeli-linked military firm, in Bristol.

The break-in occurred on August 5 last year, and involved activists armed with fireworks, an axe and a paintball gun.

Dressed in red and black jumpsuits, they stormed the compound after crashing through the gate in an old prison van.

The so-called "black team" overwhelmed a security guard who tried to fight them off with his umbrella, while the red team rammed through the barrier, Woolwich Crown Court heard.

Once on site, the protesters wreaked havoc, using sledgehammers to cause damage and attack security guards and police officers, it is claimed.

Police Sergeant Kate Evans suffered back injuries when Mr Corner allegedly attacked her with a sledgehammer.

He denies aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder alongside Charlotte Head, 29, Leona Kamio, 30, Fateema Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22 and Jordan Devlin, 31.

Mr Corner also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent to PS Evans.

Prosecutor Deanna Heer KC told the court the attack was "meticulously organised".

She said: "The premises had been targeted in advance, willing participants had been identified and a step-by-step plan of action devised and agreed upon.

"There is no doubt that these sledgehammers were intended to be used to damage property, but they were also carried as weapons to be used, if necessary, to threaten and damage people."

She said that Mr Corner went "so far as to strike a female officer across the back with his sledgehammer while she was on the floor, facing away from him".

The court was told that security guards were also injured in the melee which saw PS Evans taken to Southmead Hospital by ambulance where it was discovered she had a fracture to her lumber spine.

Ms Heer said PS Evans's injury left her unable to return to work for three months, and "since then she has suffered ongoing pain to her lower back, right hip and leg and has been confined to restricted duties".

Yesterday, Mr Justice Johnson urged the jury to put aside their views on the war in Gaza.

He said: "Many people have strong views about events in the Middle East, some of you might feel that Israel is entitled to do what it has done in Gaza in order to defend itself against Hamas.

"Others of you may feel that Israel has acted unlawfully, even that it has committed acts of genocide.

"Everyone is, of course, fully entitled to their views but you as the jury in this case must put any views you have on those matters entirely to one side, they are completely irrelevant to your consideration of the case.

"Your job is to listen to the evidence and to decide what the evidence shows on those matters you will need to decide."

The now-proscribed terror group's mission statement said: "Shut Elbit down. This is our primary objective as Palestine Action. We can do that by sticking together and ensuring it's destruction with our brains and muscle."

However, Ms Heer told the court the goal of the attack was to "close the site for a significant period of time by targeting key systems and capital to the site operations, occupy the site for as long as possible to prolong the destruction".

The prosecutor added: "The evidence in this case demonstrates that the attack upon the Elbit factory that night was planned in advance.

"The purpose was to carry out as much damage as possible, and the role of these defendants to smash up as much property as possible and to keep smashing until they were forces to stop.

"If that involved threatening the security guards or using force against them, or injuring them with those sledgehammers, then so be it - that is what they intended to do."

The trial continues.

Shortly before the strikes ensued, IDF Arabic-Language Spokesman Avichay Adraee issued an urgent warning to residents of southern Lebanon.

According to the statement, the strikes are "to address the prohibited attempts by Hezbollah to rebuild its activities in the area." The public was ordered to evacuate the areas near buildings shown on the attached maps immediately.

The warning specifically addressed residents of the village of Deir Kifa.

Following the first wave of strikes, Adraee issued a second warning, specifically for residents of Tair Filsi and Ainata. "You are located near buildings used by Hezbollah, and for your safety, you are required to evacuate them immediately and stay away from them for a distance of at least 300 meters," the warning stated.

Earlier in the day, the IDF struck and eliminated a Hezbollah terrorist in the area of At Tiri in southern Lebanon.

The terrorist took part in the efforts to reestablish Hezbollah’s readiness in the area. The IDF stressed that his actions constituted a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.

Text: 
Fox News contributor Paul Mauro joined Fox & Friends First to discuss Zohran Mamdanis stance on keeping NYPD police commissioner Jessica Tisch, his decision to tap an anti-police transition member and more.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is facing heat from two New York lawmakers who spoke to Fox News Digital after a report showing a member of his transition team espoused vitriolic anti-Israel sentiments under the backdrop of Mamdani's promises to combat antisemitism as mayor.

Hassaan Chaudhary, according to a New York Post report on Sunday, has a social media presence littered with anti-Israel posts, including calling the country "barbaric," using the term "Jew" as a slur, and praising Iran’s former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Chaudhary, who listed himself as a political director for Mamdani’s transition team, apologized for the remarks, saying the decade-old posts don’t represent his current views and that he looks back on them with "regret."

However, two lawmakers who spoke to Fox News Digital blasted Mamdani’s association with Chaudhary and warned that it shows the socialist mayor-elect is not being serious when he pledges to combat antisemitism in New York City.

"Let’s be transparent — this isn’t some innocent staffing mistake," New York Republican Assemblyman Jake Blumencranz told Fox News Digital. "This is who Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani is and what his transition team/incoming administration stands for."

"When the incoming Mayor surrounds himself with someone who uses language about Jews reminiscent of the 1930s, praises Ahmadinejad, and holds other abhorrent views, that’s not a red flag — that’s a flashing siren. Extremism isn’t a fringe element of Zohran Mamdani’s team; it’s the foundation he’s building/destroying City Hall on."

A Mamdani spokesperson told the New York Post that Chaudhary is a Muslim outreach director and not a political director, but did not say whether he would be fired.

"These comments from over a decade ago are reprehensible and in no way reflect the views of the mayor-elect or this transition," a Mamdani spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "The mayor-elect has made this clear internally and consistently during the campaign and transition."

Inna Vernikov, a Republican New York City councilwoman, told Fox News Digital the situation shows that "useful idiots on the hard left have yet to realize that they’re just small pawns in a big and dangerous game."

Vernikov added, "The same agitators screaming in defense of Hamas would be thrown off a roof for their various gender identities. Zohran needs to get one thing clear: he is no longer a protester. He now has a city of 8 million to govern."

Mamdani faced heated criticism on the campaign trail for his long track record of criticizing Israel, dating back to his days in college, where he started his school’s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. Additionally, hundreds of rabbis signed onto a letter in the weeks before the election denouncing his campaign.

Despite the outrage, Mamdani cruised to an election victory and has repeatedly promised to represent all New Yorkers, including the massive Jewish community in the city.

"We will build a City Hall that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of antisemitism," Mamdani said on election night, adding the next day that he takes the issue of antisemitism "incredibly seriously."

Still, Blumencranz told Fox News Digital that "personnel is policy" and that New Yorkers "better buckle up" if these are the type of people being recruited in the transition.

"You don’t ‘accidentally’ hire a person who has spent years spewing this kind of hate," Blumencranz told Fox News Digital. "The fact that Mamdani hasn’t immediately removed him tells every New Yorker exactly what kind of administration we’re about to get — one where bigotry is tolerated, where antisemitism is normalized, and where the most hateful voices are welcomed into the Gracie Mansion and City Hall."

The Mamdani team did not comment on Chaudhary's current employment status.

"Every resident of this city, Jewish or not, should be alarmed," Blumencranz said. "This is dangerous, it’s divisive, and it’s a disgrace."

Text: CAIRO, November 19. /TASS/. As many as 279 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since October 10, when a ceasefire took effect in the enclave, the Gaza authorities said in a statement.

According to the authorities, 652 people have suffered injuries, while another 35 Gazans have been illegally detained during the Israeli military’s raids of the enclave.

Gaza’s authorities stressed that Israel’s actions "threaten the prospects for stabilization" in the region. They called on the mediator countries to exert pressure on the Jewish state.

Tensions flared up again in the Middle East on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants staged a surprise attack on Israeli territory from Gaza, killing residents of Israeli border settlements and taking over 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a military operation in the Palestinian enclave to dismantle Hamas' military and political structures and free all hostages. According to the latest data from the Gaza Health Ministry, the enclave’s death toll from the military operations has exceeded 69,000, and over 170,000 people have suffered injuries.

On October 6, 2025, the delegations of Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas resumed indirect talks to resolve the situation in the Gaza Strip through the mediation of Egypt, Qatar, the US and Turkey. On October 9, the parties to the conflict signed an agreement on the first phase of a peace plan floated by US President Donald Trump. The Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect on October 10.

Text: The Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) announces that the 1,000th aircraft in the comprehensive military equipment and weapons airlift operation, which commenced immediately following the outbreak of war, has landed in Israel this morning (Wednesday). The aircraft, operated by Challenge Airlines IL and carrying extensive military equipment, was received at the airport by IMOD Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Amir Baram.

Since the outbreak of war, the IMOD and IDF have been conducting a cross-continental logistics airlift operation on a scale unprecedented since the establishment of the state, providing comprehensive support for all of the IDF's current and future needs. To date, over 120,000 tons of military equipment, munitions, weapons systems, and protective gear have been transferred to Israel via 1,000 aircraft and approximately 150 maritime vessels.

This joint operation is led by the IMOD's Defense Procurement Directorate (DPD), through the International Defense Transportation Unit, the IMOD Missions to the U.S. and Berlin, the IDF Planning and Force Build-Up Directorate, and the Israeli Air Force (IAF). Through this operation, advanced munitions, weapons, armored vehicles, medical equipment, communications systems, and personal protective equipment have been procured and transported to Israel.

Alongside efforts to expand Israel's defense production base, the air and maritime transport operation serves as a critical component in maintaining the operational continuity of the defense system, replenishing full stockpiles for emergencies, and ensuring rapid and precise responses to the needs of combat units in various theaters.

IMOD Director General, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Amir Baram, said: "Over the past two years, the IMOD has led a tremendous effort to ensure the supply of weapons, equipment, technology, and everything required to enable the IDF to fight and prevail. The 1,000th aircraft that landed today represents another crucial link in the strategic supply chain for the State of Israel. We will continue to operate according to the IMOD's strategy on two parallel tracks: on one hand, strengthening Israel's defense production base to ensure manufacturing independence, and on the other hand, strengthening cooperation and political and defense relations with our allies around the world, to maintain such an airlift, both in routine and emergencies, and to further strengthen the IDF's capabilities."

The IMOD Director General also expressed his gratitude to the Israel Airport Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, and all partner companies for their significant contribution to this national effort.

Text: Are we getting rolled? Again?

Israel has a wretched history of winning wars and losing the negotiations after. The territorial gains of the Sinai Campaign and the Yom Kippur War were reversed within months and those of the Six Day War have been largely dissipated in the nearly six decades since. It is why we keep fighting over the same land, repeatedly, such as Gaza, recently for the seventh but, as now seems likely, not the last time.

Such diplomatic malpractice is a result of an utter lack of strategic thinking, an inability or unwillingness to articulate our strategic goals and to insist on them in any negotiations. It is also a consequence - for decades now - of PM Netanyahu’s strengths as a conflict manager but his weaknesses as a conflict solver. He never acts decisively until he is compelled to by events and always stops short of any measures that can produce victory, much less total victory. He is a master at kicking the can down the road and then eloquently and convincingly explaining how that secures our future.

Israel’s strategic interests currently include destroying Hamas, asserting sovereignty over Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, relocating the hostile population of Gaza, neutralizing Iran, and monitoring our unfriendly neighbors to the north (Syria and Lebanon) and the south (Egypt). It does not mean we can achieve all of them, but we are presently negotiating ourselves into a situation in which none of that will be possible.

Since President Trump has declared “peace in our time,” he is less than concerned that Iran might be rebuilding its nuclear program or Hezbollah and Hamas are already rearming. Peace is already here. He is enamored with the thugs who seized power in Syria and is a sucker for flattery, the more extravagant the better.

To use a Trumpian expression, “everyone knows this.” When Putin said, “I never would have attacked Ukraine if Trump were president” (literally, a Trump campaign line,) it was music to Trump’s ears and enables him to condone Putin’s brutality and his disregard for Trump’s wishes. Every foreign visitor to the White House must pay homage to Trump as peacemaker, even if the reality is otherwise.

Of the eight or nine campaigns he claims to have ended and brought peace, most of us were even unaware that those countries were at war. These were skirmishes that - of course - will continue but gain little attention because, after all, they made peace.

Did Trump prevent us from finishing the job in Gaza? Only in the minds of those who love averting responsibility for our leaders’ own failures. He - and, truth be told, most of our government - succumbed to the notion that the main purpose of the war was freedom for our hostages, which was literally the status quo on October 6, 2023. On October 6, Hamas was in power and held no living Israeli hostages. Hamas today is weakened, but still in power, growing in popularity, and planning its next moves against us.

For Trump, the hostage release was the highlight, and he deserves acclaim for accomplishing it. We, of course, will pay the price in dead Jews, G-d forbid, murdered by some of the thousands of terrorists released from prison, in kidnapped Jews because the tactic works, and in the premature end to the latest war in Gaza.

Already, the tide is shifting against us.

The original deal called for the disarming of Hamas before the rehabilitation of Gaza begins, but it now seems that the resolve to disarm Hamas is already waning. It takes a special kind of gullibility to assume that a third-party will forcibly seize Hamas’ weapons and emasculate it as a ruling force.

Who will do it -

-The Egyptians who sealed their border to Gazan refugees who wished to flee, who have dispatched thousands of drones carrying deadly weapons to nefarious entities in the south of Israel and who allowed the massive amounts of weaponry to reach Hamas before October 7?

-Turkey - whose dictator calls our prime minister Hitler and thinks Israel has no right to exist?

-Qatar - one of the world’s leading funders of terror, long Hamas’ host and sponsor, and which already underwrites several anti-Israel organizations operating openly (our government turns a blind eye) in Yerushalayim?

-Indonesia - which has said that it will send peacekeeping forces once Hamas is disarmed?

For how long will be play this game, delaying and delaying the disarmament of Hamas until it is too late, the world’s attention has been diverted elsewhere, and this version of “peace” is applauded?

It must be stated that, indeed, Donald Trump is the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. He has done things on our behalf that are unimaginable for any other president. Undoubtedly, a President Harris would have recognized a spurious Palestinian Arab state several months ago, as did France, the United Kingdom, and Canada. (By the way, whatever happened to the punitive actions Israel was to take against those countries - closing their consulates in Yerushalayim, rethinking our ties with them, recalling our ambassadors, tongue-lashing theirs? These threats were made both by PM Netanyahu and FM Saar, and their execution? Empty as always.)

A President Harris would have embargoed arms to Israel and retracted US support at the United Nations. We would be in a far worse position.

Nevertheless, it is important to realize that Trump is the US President, not Israel’s prime minister, and he rightly acts in what he perceives to be the interests of the United States, not the interests of Israel. Because he says the right things and has been so helpful in many ways, we are lulled into thinking that whatever he does must be good for us and whatever he is planning for us is necessarily beneficial. That is a mistake.

Trump is a secular materialist. He sincerely believes that money runs the world and that people who have money downgrade and dismiss their values and principles. That is false, as proved by, among many others, Osama bin Laden, a billionaire. In this part of the world, religion is the prime mover. Ideology is supreme.

The secular materialist mind cannot understand the suicide bomber - or even today’s Gazans, among whom once again Hamas has majority support despite the devastation wreaked upon them.

The secular materialist mind cannot fathom how and why restaurants are springing up across the Arab world - including in Jordan, a country with whom we are at peace - called “October 7” in celebration of the great massacre of Jews that took place on that day.

The secular materialist mind simply does not comprehend the hold of religion in the Middle East and how it can produce such virulent ideas and actions.

What then does the secular materialist mind do? It wishes religion away, pretends it doesn’t exist, and declares peace because peace will make everyone wealthy.

Trump is a friend, but let’s face it:

If a Democratic president sponsored and endorsed a UN Security Council resolution providing for a “pathway to a Palestinian state,” most wise and sane Jews would be outraged.

If a Democratic president proposed selling America’s most advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia and Turkey - thereby eroding much of Israel’s qualitative edge - most wise and sane Jews would be horrified.

If a Democratic president precipitately ended Israel’s war on terms that were favorable to the enemy who has vowed to exterminate us, most wise and sane Jews would be apoplectic.

And yet, Trump is doing all of this, and has placated many of us, probably because he means well, and he means well despite his complete ignorance about the true nature of the hostility against Israel. Just because he is not Harris does not mean that everything he does is in our interest, and we must be mature enough to recognize that, and object when necessary - even saying a firm “no” and acting in our national interest without US support.

The reality is that much of Trump world is a chimera. Extortion, bluster, boasts, volatility, effervescence, and caprice are all part of the act. At his core, he is a huckster, a bluffer, a fulminator prone to outlandish claims and tempestuous threats (yes, I voted for him three times!). All this served him relatively well in the real estate and the entertainment industries, built as they are on such bravado, and in this unusual era, made him an incredibly and wildly successful politician.

Those traits are less helpful in effective governance. Thus, despite the braggadocio, the US dollar is its weakest in years, the deficit is skyrocketing, inflation is persistent, the on-again-off-again tariffs have not produced much in revenue and have confounded merchants, suppliers, and consumers, the health care system is a mess, the government is dysfunctional, cities are tinderboxes, China is ascendant, and little that Trump accomplishes will survive him, especially if he is succeeded by a Democrat.

Thus, his favorite expressions are “we’ll have to see what happens,” “the best ever,” or “there’s a great chance of…” whatever happening, which of course never happens. He is not held to his word or his claims because they can shift tomorrow, and sometimes even that same day. Most administrations have always operated with a “message of the day,” something they want the media to cover and report; the Trump administration offers several messages an hour, occasionally conflicting, and quite often stimulating, amusing, or distracting.

But like the emperor’s new clothes, we cannot allow Trump to force us into a reality that we know is not so. The real world in which we live is warning us that peace is not coming here anytime soon. Hamas will not merely lay down its weapons, Hezbollah is not surrendering and the Lebanese government is not anxious to provoke a civil war. An Iran even thirsting for water still prioritizes its fantasies of destroying us. We can be hopeful of the path of Syria’s new president - but also quite skeptical.

Even the Abraham Accords should be put in perspective. The original countries that joined represented a real breakthrough - an agreement between nations, including ours, of equals. But now? We have a peace treaty with Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan for more than thirty years already. What is added by them joining the Abraham Accords, other than access to American money if they seek it?

Is it worth it to us to have Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords if the price is that we effectively renounce sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, pave the road - even rhetorically - to a Palestinian state, allow Hamas to survive, and arm the Saudis to the teeth? Not as I see it.

In a perfect world, an American military base in Israel has value, especially when seeing how the large US airbase in Qatar ingratiated the Qataris to the Americans. But a base that supervises Gaza should be located… in Gaza. As “peace” now reigns, there should be no fear of having a base in Gaza.

An American base in Israel is undesirable because it will more inhibit us than it will pressure Hamas. Worse, if an American soldier is killed by a Hamas rocket, Israel will be blamed, and Jew haters in the US, already inflamed, will now add “Americans are being killed because of Israel!” to their growing list of calumnies. And foreign troops invited to a country tend never to leave. It is bad optics, unnecessary, and dangerous for them and for us, and it nullifies the traditional Israeli assertion that we do not ask any other country to defend our soil. We can still say “no, thank you.”

As Trump arms the Muslim world and finds the right words about a Palestinian Arab state to appease the Saudis, we should be concerned. We must plan for a future in which one of these well-armed Arab fiefdoms overthrown by radicals, in which the PA’s Abbas dies and is replaced by a smooth-talking, Western-educated Jew hater, who also wants to annihilate us but knows how to speak the slick, facile, and unctuous language of the West, in which the American president is someone - Democrat or Republican - who has little sympathy for Israel, cares nothing about the Jewish vote, and is now armed with a Security Council resolution in which the world endorsed a Palestinian Arab state.

Perhaps our leaders have planned for the day after. We can only pray that it is so for it never seems like it. What is comforting is that as we approach the era of complete redemption, our few allies will fade away, one by one, as our unique destiny takes center stage, and, as promised by the ancients prophets who spoke of our national return as well, G-d’s kingdom on earth will be manifest through us. May that day come soon with minimum of suffering and hardship, heralding a world of true peace and brotherhood.

Text: The US will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump told reporters ahead of a White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

"We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets," Trump said. "They've been a great ally."

The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago.

A US intelligence assessment said Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince denied any role in the murder.

Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul.

While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a "pariah" over its human rights record, Biden did visit Saudi Arabia in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting.

Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the "largest defence sales agreement in history", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms.

Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers.

Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s.

One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin.

During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects.

Text: MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky mulls resuming peace talks amid a corruption scandal, and the UN Security Council adopts a draft resolution on Gaza based on US leader Donald Trump’s peace plan. Meanwhile, the EU is not considering fast-tracking Ukraine’s membership. These stories topped Wednesday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.

On Tuesday, Vladimir Zelensky announced plans to visit Turkey on November 19 to step up negotiations on resolving the Ukraine crisis. According to Reuters, US envoy Steve Witkoff, too, will travel to Istanbul on Wednesday for talks with the Ukrainian leadership.

Last week, Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, too, arrived in Istanbul. He said holding talks with his Turkish counterparts to restart POW exchanges was the goal of his visit. Meanwhile, no Russian negotiators will attend the November 19 meeting, the Kremlin said, adding that Moscow has not received any details regarding the issue.

Zelensky’s visit to Turkey looks like a political and diplomatic trick designed to help him win support from his Western colleagues and prevent his ratings from falling further amid the corruption scandal, or the Mindich case, Nikolay Toropnin, director of the European Information Center, told Izvestia.

The idea to revive peace talks emerged as more and more politicians are insisting on putting an end to funding for Kiev amid the raging corruption scandal, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, told the newspaper.

Even Zelensky’s associates have called for dismissing chief of the presidential office Andrey Yermak, who is believed to be involved in the corruption scheme even as no official charges have been brought against him yet.

Zelensky’s statement about his willingness to boost talks is a response to the Mindich scandal and partly an attempt to divert attention, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics Dmitry Suslov believes. The Trump administration benefits from this scandal and is now trying to put pressure on Zelensky, the expert argued, as evidenced by the upcoming meeting between Zelensky and Witkoff who is the most hawkish toward Kiev and has previously pressed Zelensky for territorial concessions.

Therefore, Suslov told Vedomosti, the ongoing scandal in Kiev just adds to the US administration’s resolve to continue the pressure campaign on the Ukrainians to sit to the negotiating table. Simultaneously, even as the Zelensky administration has been struggling to succeed on the front line, Suslov doubts he would agree to any concessions to Russia. The expert attributes this to the stance of European leaders who have been persuading Zelensky not to do Trump’s bidding.

On Monday evening, the UN Security Council voted to adopt a draft resolution endorsing US President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the Gaza Strip. While 13 countries voted for the document, Russia and China, which hold a veto on the Security Council, chose to abstain from the vote. The measure provides for deploying an international stabilization force in the enclave, forming a transitional government there without any participation from Hamas, and outlines a pathway to establishing an independent Palestinian state.

The resolution is based on a 20-point peace plan put forward by Trump earlier to halt hostilities in the Gaza Strip between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement. Among other things, it authorizes a transitional governance body under the supervision of the Trump-led Board of Peace and an international stabilization force with broad powers, even as it is yet unknown exactly who will take part.

The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) welcomed the UNSC’s decision and expressed its readiness to work with the Trump administration, the EU, Muslim states and other countries toward implementing it. By contrast, Hamas rejected the resolution’s text. The Palestinian radicals, in a statement, argued that the measure imposes an "international guardianship mechanism" on the Gaza Strip that is in tune with Israel’s "occupation goals."

The latest UN resolution is unlikely to produce a positive breakthrough toward resolving the Palestinian problem, nor will it affect the policy line being pursued by the current Israeli leadership, said Viktor Smirnov, in charge of the Department of Israel and Jewish Communities at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is also Russian ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. At best, one can only expect that a ceasefire will be maintained in the Gaza Strip, the diplomat added. "Implementing Palestinians’ right would require practical steps from Israel, but the current Israeli leadership has been extremely negative not only toward the idea of offering any statehood to Palestine but also of holding talks with the PNA. The Jewish state has clearly resolved to use force to resolve the problem and it is not planning to backtrack," he explained.

Research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Lyudmila Samarskaya described the document as an important, albeit a tentative step toward the Board of Peace or an international stabilization force. "Resolving the Palestinian conflict would be extremely positive to the region and the world, but without <…> Gaza demilitarization or the PNA reform prospects of a settlement will remain distant," the expert warned.

Brussels will not accelerate Ukraine’s European integration, David McAllister, chair of the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, told Izvestia. He emphasized that any full-fledged EU membership for Kiev will be possible only after it has met all the requirements and the conflict has been resolved. Earlier, the European Commission proposed introducing a "probation period" for new EU members with some reservations. Kiev insists on being granted full membership as it sees that as a security guarantee. Experts believe that, for the time being, Ukraine has no real prospects of joining the EU, and that the bloc itself should address a series of pressing issues before accepting new members. A major corruption scandal involving people from Vladimir Zelensky's inner circle, too, is playing against Kiev.

Previously, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly stated that Russia has never opposed Ukraine’s EU membership. But the situation may change amid the EU’s militarization push, Vladislav Maslennikov, Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department of European Issues, told Izvestia. Earlier this year, the European Commission announced a €800 billion rearmament plan, with part of these funds meant for bolstering Ukraine’s defense capabilities.

Ukraine’s chances of joining the EU in the next three to five years appear bleak, according to Darya Moiseyeva, chief analyst at the autonomous non-profit organization Kolaboratoriya. Still, she noted that judging by the papers already signed between the EU and Ukraine, the prospect remains tangible and its feasibility should not be underestimated.

Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for International Studies of MGIMO, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yegor Sergeyev believes that the prospects of Ukraine becoming a full-fledged member of the EU are not visible in political, economic or institutional terms. While the EU has opened a formal path to talks on accession, the negotiations themselves have yet to begin, and a very long and difficult path is ahead, as the example of other, more prosperous countries shows.

And corruption has hit Kiev’s European prospects hardest. "A serious political and corruption crisis is clearly looming for Ukraine, but even without it, as a full-fledged EU member, Ukraine in its current form is a toxic asset that would add a significant number of problems and division to the EU," Sergeyev stressed.

Ukraine, alongside the Baltic states, has joined NATO’s anti-Russian military steps in northern Europe, judging by the idea behind Northern Strike 225 joint maneuvers currently being held between Helsinki and the North Atlantic Alliance in Lapland, near the Russian border. Ukrainian An-124 Ruslan cargo aircraft have brought Polish Homar-K MLRS capable of firing ATACMS-type missiles at targets up to 300 km away to Finland.

While Finland has hosted similar drills for several years already, since it joined NATO as a full-fledged member in 2023, it is for the first time that MLRS systems that can target facilities on Russian soil have been brought on board Ukrainian planes. And a remark from Wieslaw Kukla, the chief of the Polish General Staff, who alleged that Russia is preparing for war and said that his country is also acting in response, can hardly be called accidental.

"This looks like an escalation," military expert and retired Colonel Nikolay Shulgin told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "In geostrategic terms, the Northern Strike 225 exercise sends a clear message about the pace, scope and cohesion of NATO forces in northern Europe," Teoman Nikandji, a military analyst with Army Recognition Group, believes. In his article devoted to Finland’s artillery drills, he argued that the quick deployment of Polish MLRS systems aboard strategic warplanes shows that NATO can strengthen northern Finland with long-range precision weapons in short order. "This would complicate action planning for any potential adversary along the Finnish-Russian border and toward the Kola Peninsula," he maintained.

Shulgin noted that many politicians and military officials in NATO allies have been openly discussing a potential war with Russia. "Europe is contemplating the future militarization of Ukraine, while the true goal of ending the conflict is to disarm Kiev. This is precisely what we should aim for, dismissing any speculation about a Russian military threat," Shulgin insists.

Russia is concluding its two-year presidency of the Council of Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). As a chair, it has prioritized promoting trade, economic, investment and financial cooperation, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said at a meeting in Moscow.

The SCO currently comprises 10 countries, two observer nations and 15 partners, and its geography covers almost all Eurasia, Mishustin emphasized. Last year, exports from SCO member states accounted for around a fifth of the global volume, he added. And the SCO’s share in the global GDP has reached one-third and will rise further - to 35% this year.

SCO economies will increase their share in the global GDP, Olga Kharina, a researcher at the Oriental Studies School of the Faculty of Global Economy and Word Politics at HSE University, told Vedomosti.

According to an estimate from Gazprombank, in 2025-2030, the GDP of the SCO member countries will grow at an annual rate of 4.5% to 5%, which is ahead of the global average of 3%, Darya Tarasenko, a senior analyst at the lender’s economic forecasts center, agrees.

Economic growth within the SCO can be maintained even amid global instability, Leading Researcher at the International Laboratory for Foreign Trade Research of the RANEPA Institute for Applied Economic Studies Vladimir Sedalishchev told Vedomosti. He believes that the share of the SCO in the global GDP may soon rise to 35% and even reach 37%, if cooperation within the organization increases. "The united bloc with a population of billions of people will inevitably become a major actor in the international arena which, in turn, would give more negotiation power to its members. Further down the road, this could help member countries to reduce their dependence on Western institutions," he argued.

An Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon on Tuesday killed 13 people and wounded several others, state media and government officials said. It was the deadliest strike on Lebanon since a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago.

The drone strike hit a car in the parking lot of a mosque in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sidon, the state-run National News Agency said. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 13 people were killed and several others wounded in the airstrike, without giving further details.

Hamas fighters in the area prevented journalists from reaching the scene, as ambulances rushed to evacuate the wounded and the dead.

The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas training compound that was being used to prepare an attack against Israel and its army. It added that the Israeli army would continue to act against Hamas wherever the group operates.

Hamas condemned the attack in a statement saying the strike hit a sports playground and denying that it was a training compound.

Over the past two years, Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed scores of officials from the militant Hezbollah group as well as Palestinian factions such as Hamas.

Saleh Arouri, the deputy political head of Hamas and a founder of the group’s military wing, was killed in a drone strike on a southern suburb of Beirut on Jan. 2, 2024. Several other Hamas officials have been killed in strikes since then.

Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. That sparked Israel’s offensive on the Gaza Strip that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

A day after the Israel-Hamas war started, Hezbollah began firing rockets toward Israeli posts along the border. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon, and the two sides became locked in an escalating conflict that became a full-blown war in late September 2024.

That war, the most recent of several conflicts involving Hezbollah over the past four decades, killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.

The war ended in late November 2024 with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Since then, Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Lebanon, saying that Hezbollah is trying to rebuild its capabilities.

Lebanon’s Health Ministry has reported more than 270 people killed and around 850 wounded by Israeli military actions since the ceasefire.

Title: 311 shekels a day: State Comptroller says Israel not paying reservists enough

Text: A new report by Israel’s State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman concludes that the state is failing to adequately compensate IDF reservists. According to data he reviewed, one-third of reservists received only the minimum legal daily payment of roughly 311 shekels-equivalent to about 9,300 shekels per month-and 57% of student reservists received this low rate.

Englman published on Tuesday the eighth report in the “Swords of Iron” special audit series, which examines how the state has handled the consequences of the war.

The latest report focuses on the rights of reservists: financial compensation, protection of employment rights, and academic accommodations for students serving in the reserves.

Mass Mobilization With Unprecedented Burden

Between October 2023 and July 2024, approximately 318,000 Israelis were called up for reserve duty.

More than half served over 100 days, and nearly 13% served over 200 days, reflecting an extraordinary and prolonged burden on the reserve system.

Despite this, the comptroller found that many were compensated only at the minimum daily rate of 311 shekels, with young reservists and students disproportionately represented among those receiving minimal pay.

Englman stressed that these groups were often hit hardest economically, sometimes lacking prior income documentation required for proper compensation calculations.

Peripheral Regions Disproportionately Affected

The report highlights a stark geographic imbalance: Golan, Safed, Acre, Be’er Sheva, and Judea and Samaria bore a disproportionately high share of reservists compared to the national average.

Meanwhile, the National Insurance Institute paid an unprecedented 20 billion shekels in reserve-duty compensation during this period-four times the amount paid in comparable periods in previous years.

Yet Englman found major gaps between reservists’ pre-war salaries and the benefits they received, especially among self-employed workers, students, and citizens without stable employment prior to the war.

Students: Unequal Treatment Across Universities

A special section of the report examined reservist students, finding major inconsistencies between universities and colleges.

In some institutions, students received alternative exam dates, academic accommodations, designated scholarships, or academic credit for service-but others provided none of these, creating unequal treatment of “soldier-students.”

Employment Rights and Administrative Failures

The comptroller also exposed failures in workplace rights enforcement:

- Difficulties collecting compensation through employers

- Payment delays

- Lack of awareness among workers regarding their legal rights

He called for significantly improved outreach and clearer information for all reservists.

A Call for Systemic Reform

Englman emphasized that as the reserve corps becomes a more permanent backbone of the IDF, the state must create a sustainable and fair compensation, support, and recognition framework so that civilians can continue serving without long-term economic or academic harm.

“Reservists are the backbone of Israel’s security,” he wrote, “and the state must ensure their rights are protected and that they receive compensation and recognition worthy of their contribution. The report’s findings highlight the urgent need to reassess current policies and legislation to guarantee a fair and lasting response to the needs of the reserve system.”

Text: WASHINGTON, November 19. /TASS/. Ukraine’s corruption scandal has "sent shivers" through Europe, one of Kiev’s strongest financial supporters, columnist Ted Snider writes in an op-ed for The American Conservative.

"The corruption scandal has sent shivers through Europe, which has poured billions of dollars into Ukraine’s defense and into Ukraine’s energy sector. It has reawakened anxieties about sending money to Ukraine and about Ukraine’s candidacy for membership in the European Union," the expert points out.

According to Snider, Vladimir Zelensky’s actions "give the appearance of implicating himself." "It is not just the continuation of the corruption that has been a part of the Ukrainian government from the beginning, it is the proximity to Zelensky and the specific nature of the corruption," Snider notes. He remarks that "the investigation has zeroed in on kickbacks on contracts that were for the construction of defensive fortifications to protect those very energy installations" that Russian forces keep targeting. According to the analyst, the tapes that have been obtained by an anti-corruption agency "seem to contain conversations about delaying these fortification projects to obtain maximum profit on kickbacks from more lucrative alternatives."

"With the collapse of the anticorruption campaign and the collapse of peace talks with Russia, the two major planks upon which Ukrainians voted for Zelensky [in 2019] have collapsed," Snider emphasizes. According to him, the conflict is" going increasingly (and apparently irreversibly) badly" for Kiev.

On November 10, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) held a large-scale operation called Midas to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. The offices of businessman Timur Mindich, Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who has now been dismissed from office, and the Energoatom company were searched. According to investigators, those involved in the criminal scheme laundered at least $100 million. On the same day, NABU began publishing fragments of recordings of conversations in Mindich's apartment, in which corruption schemes were discussed. There are 1,000 hours of audio recordings in total.

On November 11, NABU filed the first charges, including Mindich as the head of a criminal organization, as well as former Deputy Prime Minister and ex-Minister of National Unity Alexey Chernyshov, who remains chummy with Zelensky. On the same day, the government prematurely terminated the powers of the supervisory board of Energoatom, and on November 12, the Verkhovna Rada received resignation letters from Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svetlana Grinchuk. Mindich, who is called Zelensky's friend and "wallet," left Ukraine a few hours before the searches and is now in Israel.

BEIRUT - The U.S. has cancelled meetings in Washington with Lebanese armed forces commander General Rudolf Hachem after objecting to a statement the army issued on Sunday about border tensions with Israel, Lebanese officials familiar with the matter said.

A Lebanese security official told Reuters the cancellations were "sudden and shocking" and prompted Hachem to call off the trip. Hachem had been due to arrive in Washington on Tuesday for meetings on military assistance and border-security cooperation.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to Reuters that the United States canceled the meetings with Hachem but did not offer a reason. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Embassy in Beirut also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Washington is a key backer of Lebanon's army, providing support of more than $3 billion over the last two decades in a policy aimed at supporting state institutions in a country where the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah has long held sway.

In Sunday's statement, the army accused Israel of "insisting on violating Lebanese sovereignty, causing instability and obstructing the army's deployment in the south".

It condemned the "latest attack" on a UNIFIL peacekeeping patrol and said Israeli actions required "immediate action" from friendly states as they amounted to "a dangerous escalation".

The Israeli military occupies five posts within Lebanon and frequently carries out airstrikes in the country's south that it says are targeting Hezbollah militants.

Israel and Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire a year ago that required the Lebanese militant group not to have any weapons in the south and for Israeli forces to fully withdraw from Lebanon.

Under the terms of the truce brokered by the U.S. and France, Lebanon's armed forces were to confiscate "all unauthorised arms", beginning in the area south of the Litani River - the zone closest to Israel.

Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Qassem has said the agreement only applies to the area south of the Litani.

Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to rearm, while Lebanon's government accuses Israel of violating the agreement by not withdrawing and continuing to carry out airstrikes.

U.S. Republican Senator Joni Ernst said she was "disappointed" in the Lebanese army's position. "(They are)  a strategic partner, and, as I discussed with the CHOD (army chief) in August, Israel has given Lebanon a real opportunity to free itself from Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists.

"Instead of seizing that opportunity and working together to disarm Hezbollah," Ernst added, "the CHOD is shamefully directing blame at Israel." REUTERS

Text: MOSCOW, November 18. /TASS/. For real change to occur in Ukraine, it’s Vladimir Zelensky that has to go, not just head of his office Andrey Yermak, Verkhovna Rada deputy Artyom Dmitruk, who left Ukraine over political persecution, said.

"The only solution that can change the situation is not a reshuffle of officials within the regime, but the complete termination of Zelensky's powers, extending to his entire office. This is not a political slogan, but an objective and inevitable stage of the political process, without which it is impossible to have any meaningful change, restore governability and form a full-fledged policy in Ukraine, one that’s not just for show," he wrote on Telegram.

According to him, Yermak's dismissal would only give the outward appearance of real change. "The current discussions of a possible Yermak dismissal and his replacement with Markarova (ex-ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova - TASS) or any other representative of an active terrorist organization are far from real institutional changes. This is a managed political spectacle designed for Western curators, as well as for internal Ukrainian public opinion. The change of personalities within a closed authoritarian and corrupt mechanism is not a reform, but a classic example of political deception," the deputy said.

Dmitruk added that Zelensky's key task now is "to buy time, create an illusion of reforms, demonstrating a public 'reaction' to challenges in order to avoid personal responsibility."

Zelensky's presidential term officially expired on May 20, 2024, but he is doing everything possible to remain in power. Former Prime Minister (2010-2014) Nikolay Azarov, commenting to TASS on the disclosure of a major corruption scheme led by businessman Timur Mindich, noted that the United States is already looking for a replacement for Zelensky.

On November 17, information appeared that Yermak may feature on the Mindich case tapes under the pseudonym of Ali Baba. On the same day, the European Solidarity (EU) and Golos parties demanded that Zelensky dismiss Yermak and the government, form a new coalition in parliament with the participation of not only the pro-presidential Servant of the People party and appoint a new cabinet over the Mindich scandal. According to deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a revolt is brewing in the Servant of the People if Yermak is not dismissed. More and more parliamentarians see a deep crisis in the Rada. On Tuesday morning, the Batkivshchina party of former Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko joined demands to create a government of national unity.


On November 11, NABU filed the first charges, including Mindich as the head of a criminal organization, former Deputy Prime Minister and ex-Minister of National Unity Alexey Chernyshov, who is Zelensky's friend. On the same day, the government terminated the powers of the supervisory board of Energoatom early, and on November 12, the Verkhovna Rada received resignation letters from Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svetlana Grinchuk. Mindich, who is called Zelensky's friend and "wallet," left Ukraine a few hours before the searches for Israel.

Muslim Reform Movement co-founder Zuhdi Jasser discusses Qatar’s role in geopolitics on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott designated the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organizations Tuesday, preventing both groups from obtaining land in the Lone Star state.

Abbott said in a statement that he made the move as "The Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR have long made their goals clear: to forcibly impose Sharia law and establish Islam’s ‘mastership of the world.’"

"The actions taken by the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR to support terrorism across the globe and subvert our laws through violence, intimidation, and harassment are unacceptable. Today, I designated the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as foreign terrorist organizations and transnational criminal organizations," Abbott added. "These radical extremists are not welcome in our state and are now prohibited from acquiring any real property interest in Texas."

A proclamation signed by Abbott claims that CAIR "is an Islamist organization that, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations, was founded as a ‘front group’ for ‘Hamas and its support network’ in the United States."

It added that, "CAIR and its members have repeatedly employed, affiliated with, and supported individuals promoting terrorism-related activities," including Ghassan Elashi, a founding member of the Texas branch for CAIR and Treasurer of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development charity "who was sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison for financing terrorism in 2009."

The proclamation also states that Hamas was "formed in 1987 as the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood" and that "activities of the Muslim Brotherhood branches have similarly been limited or prohibited by the governments of Austria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates in light of the Muslim Brotherhood engaging in terrorism or attempting to destabilize those countries."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, CAIR described itself as "an independent American civil rights organization that has spent 30 years protecting free speech, advancing religious freedom, and promoting justice for people here and abroad."

"We have consistently condemned all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism. In fact, we condemn terrorism so often that ISIS once put a target on our national executive director," the organization said.

"Although we are flattered by Greg Abbott's obsession with our civil rights organization, his publicity stunt masquerading as a proclamation has no basis in fact or law. By defaming a prominent American Muslim institution with debunked conspiracy theories and made-up quotes, Mr. Abbott has once again shown that his top priority is advancing anti-Muslim bigotry, not serving the people of Texas," it added. "The truth is that Mr. Abbott is an Israel First politician who has spent months stoking anti-Muslim hysteria to smear American Muslims critical of the Israeli government."

CAIR also said, "We have successfully sued Greg Abbott three different times for shredding the First Amendment for the benefit of the Israeli government, and we are ready to do so again if he attempts to turn this publicity stunt into actual policy."

Text: NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s offer to stay on as top cop when he takes office, The Post has learned — a bridge-building move that comes despite their profound political differences.

The highly anticipated appointment fulfills Mamdani’s campaign promise to keep the respected 44-year-old police executive in the prominent role as the far-left candidate looks to ease concerns from the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and Big Apple bigwigs as he builds out his administration.

Mamdani’s team, in a statement announcing the appointment, lauded Tisch’s leadership, driving a significant drop in crime — including record-low shootings so far this year.

“I have admired her work cracking down on corruption in the upper echelons of the police department, driving down crime in New York City, and standing up for New Yorkers in the face of authoritarianism,” Mamdani said in a statement.


Tisch, for her part, said her decision to stay came after several conversations with Mamdani.

“That’s because he and I share many of the same public safety goals for New York City: lowering crime, making communities safer, rooting out corruption, and giving our officers the tools, support, and resources they need to carry out their noble work,” she said in a statement.

Mamdani and Tisch will work together to keep NYPD cops focused on serious and violent crime, with the mayor-elect’s proposed new “Department of Community Safety” (DCS) taking the burden of dealing with homelessness and mental health issues, his team said.

The Democratic socialist’s pledge to pick Tisch — a well-respected public servant credited with leading the nation’s largest police force out of a rough patch, both on crime and within its ranks — had soothed many New Yorkers’ fears about the incoming mayor, who has been criticized for past anti-cop statements.

Critics and political opponents claimed crime would skyrocket under Mamdani, over the pol’s since-disavowed statements calling the NYPD “racist,” as well as past support for defunding the police and the proposed DCS — which would have social workers respond to many calls instead of cops.

Restive business leaders, including Tisch’s own billionaire family, and other New York power players have been pushing her to stay in Mamdani’s administration as a firewall against many radical progressive police reforms.

And establishment Democrats such as Gov. Kathy Hochul and US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) likewise said his commitment to Tisch played a significant role in their endorsements of the relatively unproven 34-year-old lawmaker.

While both are Democrats, the two will still make for an odd pairing, given their often opposing stances on public safety issues.

Tisch has been an outspoken critic of New York state government’s controversial 2019 criminal justice reforms, which law enforcement officials have slammed for creating a “revolving door” in the system that sees dangerous criminals arrested, then quickly put back on the streets to reoffend.

Mamdani, meanwhile, has crowed that the reforms haven’t gone far enough.





The commissioner also backed outgoing Mayor Eric Adams’ late-in-the-game plan to swell the NYPD’s ranks to 40,000 officers over the next few years.

Mamdani, for his part, campaigned on eliminating the police department’s overtime, building out his DCS and keeping the force at its current 35,000 budgeted staffing level.

They are also worlds apart on Israel, for deeply personal reasons.

Tisch, who hails from one of the city’s most prominent Jewish families, is a Zionist.

Mamdani, by contrast, is a longstanding vocal critic of Israel who has pledged to order the arrest of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits the city.

The telegenic leftist’s unwavering support of the Palestinian cause helped propel him to victory among New Yorkers disgusted with the war in Gaza, but has been criticized by many Jewish New Yorkers as antisemitic — a charge he repeatedly denies.

Text: Maj. Gen. (res.) Noam Tibon, former commander of the IDF’s Northern Corps, is joining the Yesh Atid party. The party announced on Tuesday that he will be placed among the top five candidates on its slate for the next Knesset.

Party chairman Yair Lapid held a press conference with Tibon, who said he was entering politics “to save our beloved State of Israel.”

“In the past two years, I’ve seen Israel’s remarkable next generation - the male and female soldiers, the reservists, their wonderful families,” Tibon said. “But I’ve also seen their pain-  the bereaved parents and siblings, the wounded in rehabilitation wards, the battle-traumatized, and the hostages who endured hell in Gaza. For their sake, we must make Israel a better, stronger, and more just country. That’s why I’ve stepped forward.”

Tibon called for a state commission of inquiry into the failures of October 7. “The next government will establish such a commission on its first day in office. This is a security imperative and a moral obligation - we will not give up on it.”

He added: “The next government must serve the public. Yesh Atid has done this twice before, and with its outstanding team, it will do so again in 2026. We deserve a different government. Instead of draft-dodging - unity. Instead of excuses - accountability. Instead of hatred - Zionism. We will rebuild the south and the north, strengthen the IDF, and support the serving public, which gives so much to the country.”

Tibon, who also commanded the Judea and Samaria Division, gained public attention on October 7 after rushing to Kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his son Amir and his family. He joined a military force and fought alongside soldiers until he reached them. A film about his actions was initially pulled from the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) earlier this year, but the decision was reversed following public outcry.

In an interview with Arutz Sheva-Israel National News nine months ago, Tibon recounted the dramatic rescue and criticized the government's handling of Hamas. “I didn’t care if I died trying to save my family. That was the situation,” he said.

Asked how such an event could happen, Tibon cited systemic failures. “There were flawed assumptions - from political beliefs that Hamas was an asset, to the infamous suitcases of dollars delivered by Netanyahu and [then-Mossad chief] Yossi Cohen, thinking money would buy quiet. Instead, it built a monster. Militarily, the assumption that Hamas was deterred proved false. The belief in an impenetrable barrier collapsed when we saw how easily it was breached. Under that illusion, the army prepared primarily for war in the north. That’s why there was such a gap in performance between the south and the north. There was also unrest in Judea and Samaria, and many forces were diverted there. The army essentially fell asleep - and so did the government. That’s why a state commission is essential. I propose a compromise: let it be appointed by the President of the Supreme Court and his deputy, Noam Sohlberg.”

Even during that interview, Tibon spoke of his intention to engage in public service, though he did not explicitly mention politics. “We have a strong and good people who understand the gravity of the moment. Meeting them brings me great joy. That’s why I fight against the ‘poison machine’ that tried to slander me, and against group labeling. When I hear people speak negatively about settlers, I say - look at the list of the fallen, stand at attention, and salute. The serving public gives me great hope that after the war, we can reboot the country and bring in new leadership from among the reservists. I have great faith in our people.”

Text: A federal judge has indefinitely barred the Trump administration from leveling a fine in excess of $1 billion against the University of California system for failures in addressing campus antisemitism.

Calling the administration’s strong-arming of the UC system “coercive and retaliatory,” US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco ruled that federal investigators had failed to follow standard protocol for Title VI civil rights investigations.

Lin’s preliminary injunction came as the UC system continues to negotiate a planned settlement with the administration related to antisemitism investigations.

Much of the Trump administration’s case against UC involves UCLA, which in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks became a hotbed of campus conflicts over Israel. Student protesters barred “Zionists” from entering certain sections of campus; brawls also broke out with pro-Israel counter-protesters. The university settled with a group of Jewish students this summer, but US President Donald Trump has continued to push aggressive fines over the objections of a contingent of its Jewish community.

A growing number of other universities, including, most recently, Cornell and the University of Virginia, have also signed deals with Trump to preserve federal funding and end antisemitism investigations. UC leaders have said the Trump-imposed fines are an existential threat to the school. A federal judge had previously ordered the reversal of Trump’s funding freeze to Harvard for similar stated reasoning around antisemitism.

University staffers and academic groups had sued the administration, saying that Trump’s actions were already having a punishing effect on their First Amendment concerns.

“Rooting out antisemitism is undisputedly a laudable and important goal,” Lin wrote in her decision. “However, the unrebutted evidence shows that the Task Force Agencies and the Funding Agencies have gone well beyond that stated purpose.”

Lin continued, “The record shows that Defendants engaged in a concerted policy to use allegations of antisemitism to justify funding cancellations, when their intent is to coerce universities into purging disfavored ‘left’ and ‘woke’ viewpoints from their campuses and replace them with views that the Administration favors.”

In a New York Times story this week about staffers who recently resigned or were fired from the Justice Department, a former lawyer in the Civil Rights Division, Ejaz Baluch, said his colleagues found that pro-Israel professors at UCLA were harassed and the school’s complaint process was flawed. But Baluch felt the fine sought by the administration was disproportionate. “We thought, $1 billion? They are making that up out of thin air,” said Baluch. “There is no way the damages we found added up to anything like that amount.”

Lin’s ruling also came amid a growing antisemitism controversy on another UC campus. UC Berkeley protesters last week chanted “Zionists out” and “Free Palestine,” with some wearing keffiyehs, as part of a larger demonstration against an event staged by right-wing group Turning Point USA, the group founded by slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. At least four people were arrested during the protests, with injuries also reported. One Jewish UC Berkeley student told the Jewish News of Northern California she was targeted with antisemitic taunts from protesters.

On Monday the Justice Department and the FBI launched an investigation into the protests.

Text: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived at the White House today (Tuesday) for his meeting with US President Donald Trump.

The meeting comes a day after Trump announced that the US would agree to Saudi Arabia's request to sell the country advanced F-35 stealth fighters.

Speaking to the press, Trump praised bin Salman's record on "human rights" and stated that he is "very proud" of what the crown prince has accomplished.

Trump also defended bin Salman from an ABC reporter's question about the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying that Khashoggi was "extremely controversial" and that the crown prince "knew nothing about it."

Bin Salman responded to the same reporter's question about the role of Saudi terrorists in the September 11 terror attacks by saying that one of the goals of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was to harm the US-Saudi relationship.

Trump also stated that "the Palestinians like me" and are "doing very well." He added that America's actions in the Middle East are making Israel and the Palestinian Arabs "Very happy."

When asked if the F-35s that will be sold to Saudi Arabia will be the same as those used by Israel, Trump responded: "I think they will be pretty similar, yeah."

According to Trump, Saudi Arabia "is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally. I know they'd [Israel] want you to get planes of reduced caliber. I don't think that makes you too happy."



Bin Salman stated: "We want to be part of the Abraham Accords, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path for the Two State Solution."

Trump also stated that he believes Bin Salman has a "very good feeling" on the Abraham Accords.

The Berlin government has stepped up its campaign to fill its ranks amid growing security threats across the continent. (Reuters.)

President Donald Trump started his campaign for Europe in general and Germany in particular to spend more of their budgets on defense during his first term, and it's starting to pay off in the economic engine of Europe, the Federal Republic of Germany.

Germany’s coalition government — Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and the Social Democrats — has agreed to a new system of incentives for voluntary military service after a heated debate last week to address the growing Russia threat to the European continent.

Incentives to generate recruitment involve free access to driving licenses. The cost of driving licenses can reach several thousand dollars. The second incentive is an increase in the existing pre-tax salary at the starting level, to around $3,000 a month.

German conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared at the start of his tenure that Germany’s armed forces would be transformed into "Europe’s strongest conventional army," Jens Spahn, the parliamentary leader of Merz’s CDU party, told reporters on Thursday. "We want to win over as many young people as possible for the service for the fatherland."

Spahn added that if the voluntary model does not secure sufficient military soldiers and personnel, "we’ll need to make it obligatory" Spahn noted, however, that the move toward compulsory conscription would mean a new law would need to be passed.

David Wurmser, who worked for the U.S. Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer, as a lieutenant commander and was a former senior advisor for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital that "Europe is finally beginning to contemplate defense and a more serious way."

"While it has never been its official policy, over the last few decades, Europeans took for granted the American umbrella and the inconceivability of war to both largely minimize any defense burden they share, as well as placed themselves as some sort of moral conscience lording over the world that ranged into pacifism and impossible moral perfection. It is a good thing that they are now forced to start soberly thinking about their defense and what that might entail."

‘MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN’: HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS

He added that "it is important that we in the United States begin to understand that the center of gravity of European civilization is shifting eastward. The fact that Germany, before Britain and France, seemed to appreciate the threat that it faces and the resulting need to stand up a more robust defense, is symbolic of that shift eastward."

According to Wurmser, "Symbolically, Germany’s actions represent a realization that is long overdue, but is not yet universally understood. That what happened in February 2022, as well as what is happening in the Middle East against Israel, are only localized versions of a much larger, dangerous, and potentially deadly global competition that is led by several nations in opposition to western civilization."

He said, "That axis represents the fusion of communist, Islamist, and fascist thought. That unholy alliance, which is an unlikely alliance, is anchored first and foremost to the loathing of Western civilization. The West will not survive unless it realizes that, and what Germany is doing is to some extent a first small step in that direction."

Trump urged Germany to pay the U.S. more for its military defense of Germany during his first term.

US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz and other ambassadors voting during a Nov 17 meeting to establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza.


Jonathan Eyal

Published Nov 19, 2025, 04:25 PM

Updated Nov 19, 2025, 05:53 PM

LONDON – US President Donald Trump has often dismissed the United Nations as a “useless” organisation, powerless to tackle the world’s conflicts.

Yet, during the early hours of Nov 18 and soon after the UN Security Council

voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses his plan for peace in Gaza,

This is, of course, a typical Trump exaggeration. Far from being a coherent document, the plan approved by the Security Council is just a list of sketchy promises about the reconstruction and future administration of Gaza.

Nor does Mr Trump see the council as having much of a say in the fate of the Palestinians; in the US President’s vision, the UN is not an actor but just a stage for diplomatic manoeuvring.

Nonetheless, the council’s resolution is an important step in handling the Gaza crisis, for it gives the US plan for the post-war order in the Gaza Strip a basis under international law. And it offers the only reliable guide into the region’s future.

The initial phase of the plan – a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian radical organisation in charge of Gaza, and the subsequent exchange of hostages and detainees between the two of them – came into force on Oct 10.

The ceasefire is still holding, although as US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz readily admitted, this remains just a “fragile first step”.

The key next stage is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to be deployed to the territory, with the task of “supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza” and “ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians”, as Mr Waltz put it.

This should be followed by the creation of a so-called Board of Peace (BoP) to serve as the overall authority ensuring Gaza’s administration, civilian aid procedures and future reconstruction efforts.

The UN Security Council voted on Nov 17 in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses Mr Donald Trump's plan for peace in Gaza.


President Trump, who included the ISF and BoP in his 20-point plan for Gaza, did not initially believe that either body needed international approval. But he was quickly persuaded that no country would commit its troops and financial resources without the UN’s formal endorsement.

The UN Security Council has now provided this endorsement. Yet, apart from the near certainty that a US military commander will be in charge of the ISF and that Mr Trump will chair the BoP, little is known about the composition or method of operation of either body.

A US-led military planning cell has operated in Israel for weeks, working out the details of a future ISF deployment in Gaza.

What has emerged clearly from its analysis is that, if it is to be effective in both disarming Hamas and ensuring local safety, the ISF should be pretty significant – perhaps comprising about 20,000 troops – and should be mainly composed of soldiers from Arab and Muslim countries, to more likely be acceptable to the local population.

Along with the US, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar are leading discussions on the creation of the ISF. In theory, this is a perfect choice. As the region’s biggest states, Egypt and Turkey have large standing armies and can deploy plenty of soldiers. Meanwhile, Qatar’s deep pockets can easily bankroll such a deployment.

In practice, however, matters are not so simple. The arrival of troops from Egypt, which is Gaza’s only immediate Arab neighbour, will be controversial, especially since the Egyptian government has always viewed Hamas as a threat.

The potential deployment of Turkish troops as part of the ISF may reassure Hamas, since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has close contacts with this radical Palestinian organisation. Yet precisely because of this, Israel strenuously objects to a prominent Turkish presence in Gaza.

The obvious solution may be to invite other Muslim nations outside the Middle East to contribute troops to the ISF; Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan are frequently mentioned in this context.

But many Arab leaders are privately voicing their disquiet at the potential arrival of soldiers who speak no Arabic and have little grasp of the local circumstances.

Nor is it clear how the ISF, once deployed, will interact with Israel, whose troops remain in control of about half of Gaza’s territory.

The Trump plan, as now endorsed by the Security Council, calls for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the Strip.

However, no timetable for this withdrawal exists, and rumours circulating in the region suggest that the US plans to start the construction of new housing for displaced Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled part of Gaza, mainly because this is now sparsely populated and more secure.

If such rumours prove to be true, Gaza may remain divided for years. And this may be precisely what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for.

The Arab and Muslim states that supported this week’s UN Security Council vote take some comfort from the fact that the resolution promises a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and, eventually, a Palestinian independent state.

This is the sort of language many Security Council members pushed for, and a pledge UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres considers as the key achievement of the current effort.

The urgent task now is to create “a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution”, a spokesman for Mr Guterres said after the adoption of the latest resolution.

However, the promise that the stabilisation of Gaza will be a stepping stone to Palestinian freedom remains hopelessly vague. There is no mention in the UN resolution of the West Bank, where Israeli settlers are currently engaged in a violent rampage against local Palestinian inhabitants.

And although the Palestinian Authority, the moderate entity recognised by the international community as the legal representative of the Palestinian nation, has expressed its willingness to take over the administration of Gaza, the authority’s 90-year-old leader Mahmoud Abbas is hardly the sort of inspirational leader the war-torn territory desperately needs.

What can be said with certainty, however, is that regardless of its obvious flaws and glaring omissions, Mr Trump’s plan remains the only basis for handling the Gaza conflict.

The US now enjoys unrivalled influence, with the UN’s seal of approval. And this is, indeed, historic.

News Analysis

An anti-Zelensky political coalition is coalescing as the president’s allies are accused of enriching themselves while the country’s soldiers die on the battlefield.

By Andrew E. Kramer


As Russian troops and missiles streamed over Ukraine’s borders on the first day of its invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky took a moment to shake hands with his main rival, former President Petro Poroshenko. The show of unity quieted Ukrainian politics for years and bolstered his wartime leadership.

That truce is now gone. A sprawling investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme has implicated close associates of Mr. Zelensky, jolting the country’s politics back to life and weakening the Ukrainian president at home as pressure on the battlefield intensifies.

As the most significant corruption scandal of Mr. Zelensky’s tenure unfolds, opponents who had lain low are coalescing into the first major anti-Zelensky movement since the invasion began in 2022. These adversaries include Ukraine’s independent anticorruption agencies, opposition parties, political activists and media outlets.

With the handshake forgotten and the gloves now off, Mr. Zelensky’s critics are speaking in once-unthinkable terms, including accusing presidential allies of betraying the country. Many Ukrainians have reacted with disgust to accusations that his allies enriched themselves while the country’s soldiers are dying in a fight for national survival.

“The country has finally seen what the expression ‘blood money’ means,” Mr. Poroshenko’s political party said in a statement about the corruption scandal. Mr. Zelensky’s wartime cabinet, the statement said, is “unprofessional and corrupt.”

No significant politicians in Ukraine are calling for Mr. Zelensky to resign, and with elections suspended under martial law, he can’t be voted out of office. But the movement coming together around corruption poses serious risks to him, analysts say.

The swelling opposition could threaten Mr. Zelensky’s control of Parliament as members of his party defect to become independents, eroding his ability to pass legislation, which has been vital for quick decision-making during the war.

Mr. Poroshenko’s party is collecting signatures for a no-confidence vote in the wartime cabinet. And Mr. Zelensky’s inner circle has also come under pressure. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a member of the opposition Holos party, has called for the resignation of Mr. Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Yermak and a small coterie of advisers hold tight control over power in Ukraine, analysts say.

“The only way forward for Zelensky is essentially getting rid of everyone” on his wartime leadership team, said Balazs Jarabik, a former political adviser for the European Union in Kyiv.

The movement against Mr. Zelensky began with street protests in July after he had moved to neutralize the anticorruption agencies that were investigating his inner circle. He quickly reversed course, but the corruption revelations this month have renewed discontent with Mr. Zelensky, as many Ukrainians demand greater transparency and accountability from the government.

Polls show that trust in Mr. Zelensky has fallen to close to 50 percent, after soaring to about 90 percent after the invasion.

Mr. Zelensky, who has been in office for nearly seven years, has not said whether he will run once elections are resumed, if Russia eventually agrees to a cease-fire, allowing martial law to be lifted.

Revelations of corruption began emerging last week, and they have touched people close to the president.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine said that a former business partner of Mr. Zelensky’s, Timur Mindich, had organized the scheme, in which at least $100 million was stolen over the last 15 months from the state nuclear power company through kickbacks to contractors. The independent investigative agency was established in 2015 with backing from the International Monetary Fund and Western donors.

Investigators said they had bugged an apartment and an office in Kyiv where Mr. Mindich and others, including a government minister and an executive at the nuclear company, discussed divvying up hundreds of thousands of dollars and moving money to Switzerland and Israel. The anti-corruption agency has been publishing the audio online.

The accusations of theft from the energy sector were all the more galling for Ukrainians — and politically sensitive for Mr. Zelensky — as the country endures hourslong electrical blackouts after recent Russian missile and drone attacks on power plants.

Mr. Zelensky has responded by asking the justice minister, Herman Halushchenko, and the energy minister, Svitlana Hrynchuk, to resign. Both submitted letters of resignation.

The National Security and Defense Council placed sanctions on the former business partner, Mr. Mindich, a part owner of the comedic television studio that Mr. Zelensky founded before becoming president. Mr. Mindich fled Ukraine shortly before a search of his home.

The government has also announced overhauls of regulatory agencies and corporate governance practices at state companies.

A former deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Chernyshov, who investigators said had accepted payments of more than $1 million, said that he was innocent and that investigators had published excerpts from the recordings out of context.

At a hearing on Monday, Mr. Zheleznyak, the opposition member of Parliament, said the government’s moves to address the corruption accusations were insufficient. He leveled criticism against government ministers who attended the hearing. It has been rare during the war for ministers to attend hearings.

The accusations of high-level corruption could cause a realignment against Mr. Zelensky in Parliament, political analysts say, returning to a norm through most of Ukraine’s recent history of presidents deadlocked with an opposition-controlled chamber. In wartime conditions, Russia could exploit those internal divisions.

Ukrainska Pravda, a leading Ukrainian news outlet, reported that a faction in Mr. Zelensky’s political party, Servant of the People, was pressing for the resignation of Mr. Yermak, the chief of staff, and threatening to leave the party if he remained in his post.

In a sign that Mr. Zelensky may be losing his ability to pass legislation, voting on next year’s budget, which was scheduled for this week, has been delayed. Opposition politicians said they intended to use debate on the budget bill to demand that new anti-graft protections be included.

Even before the scandal, Mr. Zelensky had effectively lost majority control in Parliament because of defections and resignations in his party. But he had been able to pass legislation in coalition with former members of a now-banned pro-Russia party.

“The current steps are not enough to convince Ukrainian society that something really changed, not something cosmetically,” said Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Mr. Poroshenko’s European Solidarity Party, speaking of the two ministerial resignations and the swiftly announced regulatory overhauls.

He has called for the formation of a national unity government that would include opposition figures. But he conceded that Mr. Zelensky was unlikely to cede power in this way.

Standing by aides, ministers or other officials implicated in the investigation, Mr. Ariev said, will not only “weaken him as a politician and president but it will weaken Ukraine.”

Text: New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s successful run for the city’s top job became a reality in part by getting 97% of the Muslim vote in New York’s five boroughs. However, to clinch the election, he was boosted by upwards of 35% of the Jewish vote. Mamdani’s progressive platform of free housing, rent control on private and public housing, free public transportation, city run supermarkets, significantly downsizing the NYPD, and free daycare ensured that the general public would buy into his election platform of free-giveaways, despite him being unable under any budgetary scenarios to follow through with his election promises the day after. Mamdani’s hatred of capitalism and wealthy white New Yorker’s has been a cornerstone of his election run.

Mamdani is a polite, youngish, articulate, and photogenic individual who has portrayed himself as a progressive/socialist man of the people, who cares for all New Yorkers. Yet from day one, he has surrounding himself with advisors who have publicly supported the Palestinian Arab terror organization Hamas, and have denied the Oct 7th barbaric massacre of Israeli civilians living adjacent to the Gaza Strip. Mamdani has refused to expose and explicitly condemn the culture of violence proudly displayed during the Pro-Hamas demonstrations on the streets and campuses of New York City.

To be perfectly clear, Mamdani is an anti-Semite who refuses to condemn Hamas, their supporters or their murderous calls to “globalize the intifada”, synonymous for calling for the destruction of the State of Israel. Despite all this, he has convinced 35% of the Jewish constituency of New York City, perfectly reasonable people, to act against their own best interests.

To understand what’s in store for New York City, and for New York’s Jews, all we have to do is take a glimpse into what’s happening in London, England, a city run by a Muslim mayor since 2006. London’s current Mayor Sadiq Kahn is a practicing Muslim, he is polite and has a western appearance. He regularly attends the Al-Muzzammil mosque in Tooting. He has two daughters, both raised in the Islamic faith. Khan could have, over the years, forcibly reinforced the idea that practicing Muslims such as himself are modern citizens who happen to worship Allah, yet do not belong to any kind of belief in the preeminence of Sharia Law which clearly is based on the belief that Sharia Law must be imposed on all non-Muslims. Islamist terror being the logical extension of this imposition.

Mayor Kahn could have stated that the former would not pose a threat to England or the Western lifestyle while the latter would be a “mortal threat,” but has refrained from making this distinction. The Islamic wave felt throughout London and all of England in recent years arises not from the fact that people practicing the Islamic religion are Muslim, but rather from the degree to which they adhere to the totalitarian, supremacist Islamic doctrine of Sharia. Mayor

Sadiq Kahn could have had a significant impact on the minds and hearts of many of London’s young Muslims, become a role model for Muslims who have enjoyed the privileges and benefits of living and prospering in a Western society. Mayor Sadiq Kahn could have abandoned the politically correct rhetoric about Islam and the legitimacy of terror to advance political goals, but here too he has refrained and turned a blind eye.

The wave of Islamic terror on the streets and campuses of London and other major cities such as Manchester in recent years has reinforced the general feeling that the excessive political correctness over the years shown by Mayor Kahn, the progressive Labor Party, the police forces, the judiciary system, and the mainstream media have all fostered and festered breeding grounds for Islamic terrorists in the very heart of London, England.

It is no surprise that in recent years, police forces have turned a blind eye towards Muslim gangs roaming the streets of London and sexually attacking white British women. Critics of London’s Mayor, Sadiq Kahn and critics of New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have all been silenced due to the excessive and almost Pavlovian accusation that fair criticism of Islam or even suggesting, at the very least, that Mamdani as a practicing Muslim is an issue that should raise concern among New Yorkers, are silenced and accused of Islamophobia. This silence will come at a very steep price.

To understand how the election of Zohran Mamdani will forever change the reality of living in New York, again, let’s examine the changes in London over the past two decades since a Muslim mayor was elected; The Policy Exchange report: “Unsettled Belonging: A survey of Britain’s Muslim communities”, published in 2016, found that 53% of Muslims were born outside the United Kingdom, while 93% had parents born outside the UK.

This demonstrates that an overwhelming majority of the expected Muslim population growth in New York City will occur through immigration.

The survey found that 96% of British Muslims believe that the attacks of 9/11 were not carried out by Al Qaeda. 43% of Muslims supported the introduction of Sharia law. 53% preferred to send their children to a school with strong ‘Muslim values’. 44% said that schools should be able to insist on ‘a hijab or niqab’ in uniform. 7% of Muslims support the objective to create an Islamic state. There is a small minority of British Muslims, 3% out of 4 million Muslims, around 120,000 people (not an insignificant number) supporting violent means of establishing a caliphate.

When it comes to free speech, the same survey found that 78% believed that no publication should have the right to publish pictures of Muhammad. Muslims are thus very intolerant of criticism of their religion and do not support free speech in this respect.

The survey asked whether violence is justified in a number of situations. As many as 24% sympathized with violence by organized groups to protect their religion. 18% sympathized with violence against those who mock Muhammad. 31% agreed that it is acceptable for British Muslims to keep more than one wife, even though it is illegal. 35% believed that Jewish people have too much power in Britain.

A more recent polling carried out on behalf of the Henry Jackson Society in 2024 found that only 24% of British Muslims believe that Hamas committed murder and rape in Israel on October 7, 2023. 29% of British Muslims have a positive view of Hamas, and 32% supported the introduction of Sharia law. 21% supported legalizing polygamy and 57% supported compulsory Halal food in all schools and hospitals.

The statistics reveal the general trend that the white British population of London has declined from 60 percent to 37 percent. The Muslim population of London has nearly doubled.

New York City is expected to evolve into a metropolitan with an overall Muslim population majority with all of the cultural ramifications of living in a Muslim society. Public safety will be left to the sidelines of Mamdani’s political and municipal agenda, and the powers of the NYPD will be curtailed significantly allowing Islamist extremism to flourish.

New York Jews will be the main victims of the expected Muslim majority but not the only expected victims. Violent Muslim civil disobedience will become a daily threat, and any criticism of New York City becoming just another failed Muslim city like London, Cairo, and Bagdad will be forever silenced.

Text: The organization Al-Majd Europe says it's helping Palestinians emigrate to third countries. But it has been accused of helping facilitate "forcible transfer" from Gaza. DW spoke to a representative of the organization.

It wasn't the first such flight out of Israel, but it was the first to get so much attention. Late last week, 153 Palestinians from Gaza arrived in South Africa on a charter flight from the Israeli airport of Ramon, but they arrived without the correct documentation.

Given how tightly Israel controls its borders — and those of the Palestinian territory that the passengers had to cross to make it to the Israeli airport — South African authorities couldn't work out how the plane had even managed to leave.

Later on, it seemed to be because the Palestinians' travel had been arranged by an organization called Al-Majd Europe.

On its website, the organization says it arranges "humanitarian evacuation." But activists have been raising concerns about flights organized by Al-Majd Europe since summer.

Al-Majd claims it was founded in Germany in 2010 and is now located in Jerusalem. However no such company or charity exists in German registries, and Israeli researchers say the same is true there

Al-Majd's website uses pictures of individuals from other crisis situations and claims them as its own. The website's IP address, and therefore its real location, is hidden by privacy software.

The "donate" button on the website doesn't work. DW's own research shows Al-Majd has only ever received $106 (€91) worth of cryptocurrency via the Bitcoin account it lists — despite the fact it says it works with donations to assist the needy.

The Palestinian passengers who traveled with Al-Majd to South Africa told journalists they paid between $1,500 and $2,000, but this was sent to personal accounts.

This week, an investigation by Israeli newspaper, Haaretz found more anomalies, including that Al-Majd is connected to Tomer Jamar Lind, an individual with dual Israeli-Estonian citizenship who's based in London.

The air charter companies — Fly Yo, based in Romania, and Kibris Turkish Airlines, based in Cyprus — that took the Palestinians to South Africa are both Israeli owned.

Because of all of this, activists, South African politicians and media raised concerns that Al-Majd could well be part of a plan to transfer Palestinians out of Gaza.

"The reports about people being flown to sometimes unknown destinations by Al-Majd are deeply troubling," says Tania Hary, executive director at Gisha, an Israeli non-profit advocating for Palestinian freedom of movement. "It appears that this questionable private entity is taking advantage of people's desperation and beginning to quietly fulfil Israel's vision for transfer of Palestinians."

In February 2025 US President Donald Trump spoke about his "Gaza Riviera" plan, which would require moving locals out of Gaza to third countries. The same month, Al-Majd started advertising its services to Palestinians on social media. In March, the Israeli government announced it would create a "directorate of voluntary emigration" within its Ministry of Defense.

Rights groups in Israel raised the alarm back then and say they still don't have much information about the directorate now. Hari says that a policy of "voluntary emigration" from Gaza is supported by senior Israeli politicians, and that Israeli intelligence agencies previously sent text messages to Gaza residents "inviting them to explore departure options."

DW asked the Israeli Ministry of Defense about any connections to Al-Majd Europe but did not receive a reply by the time of publication Tuesday night.

DW was able to contact a man named Omar, whose number is listed on Al-Majd's website. In an interview via WhatsApp, he said he was a Palestinian living in Jerusalem but wouldn't give further details, including his last name, for security reasons.

He told DW that speculation about Al-Majd's connections to the Israeli government is being spread by two groups — the militant Hamas group, which used to govern Gaza and is classified by multiple countries as a terrorist organization, and the Palestinian Authority, which governs the occupied Palestinian West Bank territory. He implied these two groups don't want people to leave Gaza.

Omar also said that, in order to get people out of Gaza and to the airport in Israel, Al-Majd had to be in touch with Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, which runs Israel's official business in Gaza. COGAT is also part of Israel's defense ministry.

"I'm helping my people in Gaza, and this isn't emigration," Omar insisted. "I'm helping people who want to live, not die inside Gaza."

But Omar refused to answer more challenging questions, for example about connections to Lind, how he got in touch with international, Israeli-owned charter companies and why the links on Al-Majd's website don't work. Nor would he explain Al-Majd's finances, and he said he "couldn't remember" how many Palestinians had left Gaza with Al Majd.

So it remains unclear whether Al-Majd is connected to the Israeli government, whether it could be a private citizens' initiative in support of the government's policies or whether it is simply a money-making venture.

What is certain though is that Israeli security forces would have had to cooperate with the charter flights that left the country.

Israel has restricted Palestinians' freedom of movement since 1967, when it occupied the Palestinian Territories. Those restrictions have evolved depending on the level of tensions between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. Before the current conflict, travel out of Gaza was allowed for work, for medical treatment or in "exceptional humanitarian cases," such as the wedding or funeral of a first-degree relative.

Today, with Israel's blockade of Gaza, since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, it's even harder to leave the coastal enclave — although since the announcement of the directorate of voluntary emigration, Israeli media reports suggest it has become easier.

There are no official numbers on how many Palestinians have left Gaza.

The World Health Organization has organized 2,589 medical evacuations this year, with 5,000 companions. It's also thought that in early 2024 more than 100,000 Palestinains made their way to Egypt. But since then, as the Times of Israel reported in May this year, there haven't been as many departures.

The issue of Palestinians leaving Gaza, even now, is politically fraught.

"Under international law, every person has the right to live in their country in safety and dignity, to leave for their own security or any other reason and to return to it," explains Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. "The challenge in the Israeli-Palestinian context is that the Israeli government has a decades-long track record of blocking Palestinian refugees from their right to return home."

In May, a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that around half of Palestinians in the occupied territories would be willing to apply to emigrate. And beneath Al-Majd Europe's posts on TikTok, you'll see hundreds of comments from desperate Palestinians.

"Under today's devastating conditions in Gaza, any such 'encouragement' cannot amount to free choice," argues Gisha director Hary. "All the more so as Israel refuses to guarantee that people who leave will be allowed to return. Taken together, the unlivable conditions and the official promotion of 'voluntary departure' reflect a pattern of forced transfer disguised as free choice."

Forcible transfer of a population is a crime against humanity under international law.

There's nothing voluntary about Palestinians leaving Gaza, Human Rights Watch's Shakir confirms.

"The critical context here is that the Israeli government has pursued a policy to deliberately make Gaza unlivable," he concludes, "and the ceasefire has not changed that reality."

Text: It's the first time MBS has come to the U.S. since Jamal Khashoggi's murder.

Tuesday marked the first time Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has set foot in the U.S. since 2018, following what U.S. intelligence has said was his approval of an operation that led to the murder of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, causing global outrage.

As they met in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump responded to questions about 9/11 families angered over the visit and Khashoggi, saying of the murdered journalist and MBS, "things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that."

Shortly before, Trump welcomed him to the White House with a lavish arrival ceremony, complete with Saudi flags flying next to American flags, a red carpet, a contingent of horses and a military color guard.

Cannons were fired in the background and a military flyover, featuring three F-35 and three F-16s fighters, took place overhead.

Trump and MBS shook hands and smiled for the cameras before entering their bilateral meeting.

"It's an honor to be your friend and it's an honor that you're here," Trump told later MBS inside the Oval Office.

When ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked both men about Khashoggi's murder and the anger 9/11 families have expressed over MBS's visit to the Oval Office, Trump angrily defended the prince, telling Bruce, "You don't have to embarrass our guest asking a question like this.

"As far as this gentleman is concerned, he's done a phenomenal job," Trump said of the prince. "You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial," he said referring to Khashoggi. "A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that."

The crown prince has previously denied ordering the murder of Khashoggi but ultimately acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom's de facto ruler. In 2021, a report from the U.S. intelligence community found, "We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi."

It added, "The Crown Prince viewed Khashoggi as a threat to the Kingdom and broadly supported using violent measures if necessary to silence him."

On Tuesday, MBS addressed both 9/11 and Khashoggi.

"I feel painful about families of 9-11 in America, but we have to focus on reality," he said.

The prince alleged that Osama bin Laden used Saudis to destroy the relationship between the kingdom and the United States.

"We've been working to prove [bin Laden] wrong and continuing developing our nation. It is critical for the safety of the world," he said.

MBS said of "the journalist" that "it's really painful to hear, anyone losing their life for no real purpose."

"It's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia," he said. "We've did all the right steps of, investigation, etc., in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake. And we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again."

Just before that exchange, Bruce asked Trump about whether there was a conflict of interest with his family doing business in Saudi Arabia while he was president, as The Trump Organization has multiple active projects in the kingdom.

Last month, the Trump Organization also announced plans for a Trump Plaza to be built in Saudi Arabia, complete with “a vibrant green spine inspired by Central Park that brings Manhattan-style vibrancy to the heart of Jeddah.”

Trump insisted he has nothing to do with his family business.

"What my family does is fine. They do business all over. They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually. They could. I'm sure they could do a lot. And anything they've done has been very good," he said.

Trump will host a dinner for the Saudi leader on Tuesday night with a who's who of guests.

Billionaire Elon Musk was slated to attend, marking his first time back in the White House after he left the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a source with knowledge of the plans told ABC News.

Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays in the Saudi Pro League, will also be at the White House Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to ABC News.

Ahead of the Tuesday meeting, the crown prince had apparently scored a highly coveted weapons deal that includes advanced F-35 fighter jets from the U.S.

Trump confirmed on Monday during an event in the Oval Office that he plans to sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a weapons deal, which experts say would mark the first time those jets have been sold to an Arab military.

Trump and MBS spoke with reporters in the Oval Office, where the president said he was "very proud" of the job the crown prince had done.

The president touted the business deals and economic cooperation.

"We've been really good friends for a long period of time. We've always been on the same side of every issue," Trump told MBS as he smiled on.

Now more than seven years later, the Saudi leader has business on his mind as he seeks to deepen ties with the U.S. through cooperation on oil and security, while also expanding the regime's global outreach in finance, artificial intelligence and technology. Saudi Arabia notably boasts the world's largest economy and maintains its lead as the world's top oil producer.

The prince's trip to the U.S. is being billed as an "official working visit," and is designed to follow up and advance on Trump's May appearance in Riyadh -- the first official visit of Trump's second term in office.

During that May visit, Trump announced a $142 billion arms package with the Saudis, which according to a White House fact sheet was the "the largest defense cooperation agreement" Washington has ever done.

"A lot of the financial and economic and artificial intelligence deals that they announced that were very ambiguous six months ago, I think we might start to see some teeth from them this time around and hopefully get a little bit more clarity on what those deals actually are," said Elizabeth Dent, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and former director for the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula in the office of the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon.

The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen U.S. defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said.

Features from the deals included, a multi-billion dollar investment in America’s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales to enhance defense cooperation between both countries and fulfillments of the Saudis’ $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.

The kingdom in turn announced a $600 billion investment in the U.S. spanning multiple sectors, including energy security, defense, technology, global infrastructure and critical minerals.

"We believe, in the future openness of America. We believe in what you're doing, Mr. President, really creating a lot of good things on good foundation to create more economic growth, more business in America," the crown prince said.

Some of the other notable deals announced under the $600 billion pledge included investments in: U.S.-based artificial intelligence data centers and energy infrastructure; advanced technologies; Saudi infrastructure projects; U.S. energy equipment and commercial aircraft; the U.S. health care supply chain; and U.S. sports industries.

The potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to the Saudi kingdom is likely to cause consternation from Israel.

U.S. law requires that any weapons sale package to countries in the Middle East does not risk Israel's security, and it's unclear if Trump has cleared that hurdle in permitting the sale of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

"There's a whole host of issues that encompass this. Part of it is that Israel has to be able to maintain their congressionally-mandated qualitative military edge, which Congress does determine that," Dent said. "And so, if the deal goes forward, I think we just have to see how they're going to figure out the best way to ensure Israel can maintain that, as the only country in the Middle East that currently has F-35s."

"I think the Israelis are probably pretty uncomfortable with these rumors swirling around without normalization in sight," Dent added.

The Saudi leader is seeking security guarantees from the U.S. amid turbulence in the Middle East. The security agreement with the U.S. has been in a development stage and has not yet been formalized, but the kingdom is seeking to deepen military and security ties between the two countries.

The security guarantees are viewed by some as part of a larger regional "megadeal" involving normalization with Israel, something Trump will surely push for, even as the Saudi kingdom has refused to do so under the current Israeli leadership.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday that he would discuss the issue with the crown prince.

"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly," he said.

Earlier this year, Trump signed an unprecedented defense pact with Qatar via executive order that recognizes the "enduring alliance" between the U.S. and Qatar and provides Qatar an explicit security guarantee in the event of "external attack."

Many analysts have said they believe the Saudis are looking for a similar defense pact with the U.S.

"I think it'll be kind of similar to Qatar's, where it basically just says it will consider any sort of threat or attack on Saudi Arabia to be an attack on the United States, and then the United States will respond appropriately, which could range from political to military options. So, I think that the administration will make sure to give themselves that decision space," Dent said. "There's a lot to work through here. Obviously, I think a lot of it will be about expectation management."

The kingdom is notably invested in implementing the president's 20-point Gaza peace plan. The kingdom has previously stated it wants to see the emergence of a credible path toward an independent and a free Palestine as a condition for supporting the demilitarization of Hamas and reconstruction of Gaza.

But Israel has put up a roadblock to Palestinian statehood, which will undoubtedly cause angst among Arab regional partners who are pushing for sustained peace in Gaza.

"Our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday during his weekly cabinet meeting. "Gaza will be demilitarized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way."

Netanyahu has long opposed a Palestinian state, saying in recent months that its creation would only reward Hamas and endanger Israel's security.

At a summit in South Korea last month, President Donald Trump halted a speech he was giving about how he was doing more than any other president ever to build data centers and employ American workers, and asked about a new friend.

“Jensen, who’s an incredible guy, he might be here,” Trump said of Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia. “I don’t even know. Is Jensen here? I think he’s around. Somebody said he’s here. How is he? Pretty good, right?”

Speaking at a conference in Washington within hours of Trump, Huang also had fond words for the president, praising the White House for dismantling regulations and encouraging investment in artificial intelligence. Trump had “completely changed the game” for artificial intelligence, Huang said. Then he jumped on a flight to try to join Trump in South Korea.

Those mutual words of admiration spoke to what has arguably become the most important relationship between the Trump administration and the business world, an unlikely pairing of a Silicon Valley engineer turned mogul and a New York real estate mogul turned president.

Nvidia, which makes powerful computer chips that are essential to AI projects, has been one of the first American tech companies to follow through on promises to Trump to bring some of their manufacturing to the United States. And Trump, who closely watches how the stock market is performing, is keenly aware that Nvidia has become the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

The company’s chips have also given the president a powerful bargaining lever with a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia, Britain and China. They have even played a role, which has never been reported before, in the administration’s peace mediations between several nations.

Much as the United States offered nuclear technology in the 1950s to countries that agreed to use it peacefully, the Trump administration has discussed selling AI technology to countries that end conflicts, including Armenia and Azerbaijan, said two people familiar with the administration’s actions who spoke on condition of anonymity because of sensitivities around an emerging strategy.

In August, after the administration helped broker a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, met with officials from the countries about AI and future technological exchanges between the countries.

Mkhitar Hayrapetyan, minister of High-Tech Industry of Armenia, said that the cooperation on technologies started years ago, but that Trump and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had brought the partnership to “a new level of development.” He added, “This is an important part of our long-term modernization efforts alongside with the U.S.-Armenia partnership framework.”

Last week, Kazakhstan signed onto the Abraham Accords, a landmark agreement made during the first Trump administration to normalize ties between Israel and several majority-Muslim countries. The country also announced a $2 billion deal to develop AI data centers with Nvidia chips.

A U.S. official said the Nvidia chips played a minor role in the talks. But their inclusion in the discussions show how AI and Nvidia have become a tool for American diplomats and a president who is trying to compile peace deals as he campaigns for a Nobel Prize.

Representatives of Azerbaijan didn’t immediately provide comment. Those for Kazakhstan didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, acknowledged Trump’s relationship with Huang but said that “no single relationship defines the second Trump presidency.”

“President Trump has close personal relationships with countless business leaders across industries — relationships that are paying off for the American people as the administration works with businesses to secure historic deals,” he said.

John Rizzo, an Nvidia spokesperson, said the company supported Trump’s efforts to make more semiconductors in the United States. He added, “Nvidia has always worked to help the government understand our technology but we do not determine U.S. export policy.”

In his first term, Trump expressed similar fondness for Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, which was then the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But the president was more focused on industries like steel and cars and appeared to have little interest in advanced technology, people close to him said.

That was before Nvidia’s chips became the one thing AI projects could not do without, and the soaring share price of Nvidia became an essential component of stock portfolios.

Huang has had good reason to cultivate a relationship with Trump. The president holds the keys to international and domestic regulation of Nvidia. He controls the licenses that allow Nvidia to sell to major markets like China, and can help the company’s customers get access to the electricity they need to power Nvidia’s chips.

White House policies have helped Nvidia accelerate its business. Wall Street expects the company, which reports financial results Wednesday, to report a quarterly profit of more than $30 billion for the first time, eclipsing the incomes reported by tech heavyweights such as Amazon and Apple.

Still, when Trump returned to the White House, his relationship with Huang was far from guaranteed. Huang had never spent much time in Washington and was among the few prominent tech executives to miss Trump’s inauguration in January.

About two weeks after the inauguration, Huang and the president struggled to connect as they met for the first time in the Oval Office, said three people briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A second encounter at Mar-a-Lago also went poorly, with Huang failing to dissuade the president from banning some Nvidia chip sales to China.

But this spring, their relationship began to blossom, after Huang pledged to invest heavily in U.S. factories.

In late April, Huang announced at a White House news conference that Nvidia and its suppliers would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing. Days later, he joined the president on his first international trip and helped facilitate more than $200 billion of chip sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Trump, who considered the deal a triumph, started calling Huang “my friend.”

“What a job you’ve done,” Trump said during a speech in Saudi Arabia. “We are proud to have you in our country.”

The Middle East deals provided a template for using AI chips as a tool of foreign policy, said the two people familiar with the administration’s strategy. For years, the government has strengthened diplomatic ties with countries by selling U.S. products such as Boeing planes. But the Trump administration began to fold in AI chips and partnerships.

What also endeared Huang to Trump was Nvidia’s willingness to go along with the president’s interventionist approach to big business, some of these people said. In August, Trump suggested that the U.S. government take a cut of its chip sales to China, and Huang agreed. Though the idea appears to violate U.S. law, Huang said at the Washington conference that the Trump administration was working on a new regulation to permit it.

The global demand for Nvidia’s chips has made Huang one of Trump’s regular traveling companions. Before a state dinner in Britain this fall, Trump mused that AI “is taking over the world.” He then turned to Huang.

“You’re taking over the world, Jensen,” he said, as he and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain signed a “Tech Prosperity Deal.” “We both hope you’re right.”

As he has become close to Trump, Huang has worried officials in Washington, including some of the president’s closest advisers, by downplaying the national security risk of giving cutting-edge chips to China. He has argued that the alternative — Chinese companies building something just as good — would be far worse.

In late October, Huang returned to the Oval Office and presented Trump with a shiny reflective silicon disk — among the first examples of Nvidia’s new AI chip made in Arizona. It was a marked contrast from Trump’s experience with Apple, which had promised for years to invest in the United States but never made a marquee product domestically.

The gift came as Huang was lobbying the president to allow Nvidia to sell a version of its more advanced chip, known as the Blackwell, to China. The company also wanted Trump to help remove other barriers to its business there.

A few days later, as the president flew to South Korea to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump ignited a firestorm by musing about selling advanced chips to China. “We’ll be speaking about the Blackwell,” he told the news media Oct. 29.

The statement drew swift rebukes from lawmakers and Trump’s own advisers. Cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, raised objections to the sales for national security reasons, said two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions. The pushback was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.

By his return flight, Trump appeared to have reversed himself. He said that he and Xi had discussed chips, but “not the Blackwell.” In an interview with “60 Minutes,” Trump said that nobody would have “the most advanced” chips “other than the United States.”

The incident provided a snapshot of the limits of Huang’s bond with the president. And it showed that national security-related fears of China catching up to the United States in the race to build AI can still, for now, outweigh the financial prospects of the companies that make that technology.

Huang, who didn’t make it to South Korea in time to see Trump, hasn’t given up on the idea. In a statement last week, he said, “It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.”

Text: At least 94 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have died in Israeli custody in less than two years, a well-regarded Israeli human rights group says.

A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges a practice of "systematic killings and cover-ups".

The report covers the period between 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, sparking the latest conflict in Gaza, and 31 August 2025. It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.

The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it "operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies".

It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.

"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff," the IPS added.

Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.

PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as "security prisoners".

It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.

Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.

PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.

Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.

PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.

It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.

PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had "effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse".

It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.

The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.

Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.

Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.

The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some "right to rape" protests outside the jail.

The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to "cover up" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.

In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.

The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.

It examined a policy of what it called "forced disappearance", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.

PHRI said these "grave violations of international law" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.

The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.

The IPS said "the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented".

It continued: "Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.

"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases."

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates "in accordance with Israeli and international law", and "detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities".

It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others "preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions".

"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law," it added.

The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police.


Displaced Palestinians face life-threatening conditions, as aid agencies appeal for more shelters to be allowed in.



Four fully-funded scholarships for Palestinians have been created at the University of Sussex.

Israeli security forces inspecting a vehicle at the site of a reported ramming and stabbing attack in the area of Gush Etzion Junction in the West Bank on Nov 18.



Updated Nov 18, 2025, 11:27 PM

JERUSALEM - One man was killed and three other people were injured in a car ramming and stabbing attack in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Nov 18, the Israeli military and ambulance service said, in what the Israeli authorities described as a terror attack.

The Israeli military said in a statement two attackers were also killed by soldiers, but did not provide further details. It said that explosive materials were found in the vehicle used by the attackers, which were “being neutralised by Israel Border Police bomb disposal specialists”.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

The attack took place between Bethlehem and Hebron at a junction that is a traffic hub at the entrance to a cluster of Israeli settlements known as the Etzion bloc.

The Israeli ambulance service said a 30-year-old man died of a stab wound. A woman was in serious condition, while a man and boy were in moderate condition.

The attack comes against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has held since Oct 10.

In the West Bank, Palestinians have faced tightened military restrictions and a surge in violent attacks by Jewish settlers.

Israel has been under mounting international pressure to

curb the attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Nov 17 he would urgently convene Cabinet ministers to ensure Israelis behind the latest attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank are brought to justice.

On Nov 17, Israelis torched homes and vehicles in Jab’a, a Palestinian village near Bethlehem, after an earlier attack on property and civilians in the village of Sa’ir, the Wafa news agency said, quoting officials.

“The Jewish rioters in Judea and Samaria harm the State of Israel, disgrace Judaism, and cause damage to the settlement project,” said Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on social media platform X on Nov 17.

“They are not us. They are not the State of Israel. The IDF (Israel Defence Forces), the Shin Bet (Israel’s domestic intelligence service) and the Israel Police must act decisively and firmly to stop this rampage, which is also directed at our soldiers and police officers.”

In November, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said settlers staged at least 264 attacks on Palestinians in October – the highest monthly tally since the UN began tracking incidents in 2006.

Home to 2.7 million Palestinians, the West Bank has long been at the heart of plans for a future Palestinian state existing alongside Israel. Successive Israeli governments have encouraged Israeli settlements to expand rapidly in the West Bank, fragmenting the land. REUTERS

Text: I stopped counting the massive numbers of articles--both before and after the election of November 4, 2025--that predicted the complete devolution/collapse/implosion of New York City, a huge exodus of both Jews and Christians, as well as businesses and the Wall Street financial district to friendlier climes in what was anticipated to be the full-fledged conversion of the Big Apple from capitalism to communism, from law-and-order to a runaway crime wave, and from historical diversity to full-bore anti-Semitism and the passionate embrace of Islamism and Sharia Law if Zohran Mamdani was elected Mayor.

None of it phased me. I didn’t even watch the returns.

But the next day, I did read about the Democrat “sweep” in, predictably, Blue States. And that didn’t phase me either.

Why? Because I know both American history and Jewish history and both of these blazingly inspiring histories have survived and prevailed quite gloriously over far bigger fish than the diminutive Mamdani with his high-priority agenda, including his inflammatory embrace of Hamas, his stated hatred of Jews and Israel, his embrace of the Democratic Socialists of America and their annihilating mission statement to purge NYC of all things Jewish--and to “arrest Netanyahu and active IDF soldiers for war crimes.”

Add to that his promise to empty the city’s prisons of all its hard-core criminals, and his determination to replace the vital life-protecting and life-saving services of the police department with social workers.

Can’t make this up!

HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

Daniel Greenfield gives us the cold hard empirical numbers. “In 1989… Jews outnumbered Muslims in NYC roughly 4 to 1. By 2013…the number of Muslims had doubled, and the number of Jews continued to drop.”

When Mamdani beat Andrew Cuomo, there were more Muslims than Italian Americans in NYC, Greenfield continues. There was no Irish candidate…because the Irish population “long ago dropped below that of Muslims.” And the Polish population represented by Curtis Sliwa is even smaller.

These populations, “were replaced by college students, hipsters and third-world immigrants who not only voted for Democrats, but for the far Left.”

And “much of New York City no longer even speaks English. That’s why Mamdani could campaign in Arabic.”

Actually, no one should be shocked by this election. While Americans were apparently distracted or not paying attention or stupidly thinking that they were being virtuous and tolerant by embracing a genuinely suicidal form of diversity, Muslims were steadfastly pursuing their decades-long blueprint of converting all western countries--as they have in Europe--to an Islamic caliphate.

And whaddaya know? In this last election, as reported by the RAIR Foundation, 42 Muslims were elected to prominent offices across the United States.

IT WON’T TAKE LONG

I live about 20 minutes from NY City, and I know the city well. I give the first five innocent citizens who get pushed off the subway onto the tracks, who get raped violently while taking a morning run, who get clocked in the face while walking down the street only to end up in an emergency room with a fractured cheekbone or a gouged-out eye, who get waylaid in horrific traffic jams for over an hour while hordes of Muslims listen to the blasting siren for prayer all over the City--five times a day!--before there are enormous rallies and organized campaigns that call for Mamdani to be impeached.

As for the Democrat victors who won races for governors -- Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey--just watch the crime rates escalate dramatically--as they do in all Democrat-run states (and also Democrat-run cities), and then watch the massive exodus on unprecedented levels by citizens and businesses to sane, law-and-order states and cities run by Republicans. Never fails.

We are looking at theater here, but more dramatic--and consequential--than Broadway!

Yes, the failed public-school system in our country has indoctrinated our youth with the notion of a victim mentality, that America the Beautiful is not beautiful at all, but instead a racist, misogynistic, exploitive political system that is not “fair” … to whom?

In their view, to all the people who don’t like to work but who do like depending on the government for food, housing, cell phones, medicine, basically everything. Basically, communists! And actually, communism is a system that has failed thunderously in every country where it has been tried. Socialism is not far behind.

SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

Remember the hugely powerful and ancient Egyptian Empire? That empire, like Mamdani & Co., hated the Jews and forced them into over 200 years of brutal slavery. Today, that empire has been extinct for centuries, while the teeny tiny population of Jews continued to survive and in many instances flourish.

How about the even more powerful Babylonian Empire, from which the all-important Babylonian Talmud was transcribed from the oral law to the written law? Same history, same ending. Gone. But still, the Jews prevailed.

Then there was the highly influential Persian Empire. Strong, dominant, quite sure that those damn Jews could and would be conquered. Yep! Gone, but the Jews were still a cohesive people, struggling but alive.

Not to omit the immense might of the Greek Empire. Um… gone while those pesky Jews continued to make disproportionate contributions to mankind, as they do today.

And then there was the mightiest of all, the Roman Empire--armed, dangerous, focused, resolute and determined to finally conquer those obstinate Jews who constantly claimed there was only one God, who gave the world the Torah and the Ten Commandments and Jesus, again the list of contributions is too long to recount here.

And where is the Roman Empire now? Gone! And the Jews? Still contributing astounding contributions to the world in subjects as diverse as medicine, scholarship, science, literature, invention, computer science, environment, technology, on and on and on and on.

And, as usual, still aggravating their neighbors and the little Jew haters like Zohran Mamdani and Nick Fuentes and Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, et al, who hilariously believe that they are more powerful-- with all their Ivy League words and media connections--than all the armed empires that fell into ignominy before them.

THE PENDULUM

The pendulum of history continues. Back and forth it goes, from the far left to the far right, and sometimes it lands in the middle, as it did in the quite harmonious 1950s.

I suspect that after the misguided election of Mamdani and those leftist governors in VA and NJ, and even Jay Jones being elected as the Democrat Attorney General of Virginia after he threatened to shoot a Republican in the head, the voters who cast their votes for these candidates will begin to smell the coffee and realize that the people they voted for have yielded nothing positive, nothing productive, nothing life-affirming, nothing good.

National conservative TV and radio host Wayne Allyn Root has a remedy for the Mamdani phenomenon. It is too lengthy to include here but I urge all readers to click on this link to enjoy his truly unique and original ideas.

In the next go-round, the midterms in 2026, I predict that we will see the same thunderous victories for conservatives as we saw in the monumental victory of President Trump in 2024.

Russia and China abstained in the vote, which provides a legal mandate for the Trump administration’s vision of how to move past the cease-fire to rebuild the war-ravaged enclave after two years of war.

The United Nations Security Council on Monday approved President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, a breakthrough that provides a legal U.N. mandate for the administration’s vision of how to move past the cease-fire and rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip after two years of war.

The Council’s vote was also a major diplomatic victory for the Trump administration. For the past two years, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has raged, the United States had been isolated at the United Nations over its staunch support for Israel.

The U.S. resolution calls for an International Stabilization Force to enter, demilitarize and govern Gaza. The proposal, which contained Mr. Trump’s 20-point cease-fire plan, also envisions a “Board of Peace” to oversee the peace plan, though it does not clarify the composition of the board.

The resolution passed with 13 votes in favor and zero votes against. Russia and China, either of which could have vetoed it, abstained, apparently swayed by the support for the resolution from a number of Arab and Muslim nations: Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan, which is a member of the Council.

Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who addressed the Council before the vote, called Gaza “hell on earth” and held up a copy of the resolution, describing it as “a lifeline.” After the vote, Mr. Waltz thanked the Council for “joining us in charting a new course for Israelis, Palestinians and all the people in the region alike.”

Security Council resolutions are considered legally binding international law, and although the Council does not have a mechanism for enforcing such resolutions, it can take measures to punish violators with penalties such as sanctions.

In post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump wrote: “Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World.”

He thanked various countries, including Russia and China, and said the vote “will lead to further Peace all over the World.”

Still, the path forward is plagued by many uncertainties, with Israeli strikes continuing in Gaza and outbreaks of violence erupting in the West Bank. Among the next steps would be naming members of the Board of Peace, the body in charge of overseeing the transition in Gaza, and clarifying under whose authority the stabilization forces would operate.

The resolution says that if the Palestinian Authority, which partly governs the West Bank, undergoes reforms and the redevelopment of the shattered Gaza Strip advances, the conditions “may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”

Algeria’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amar Bendjama, the only Arab member of the Council and who was negotiating on behalf of the United Nations’ Arab Group, thanked Mr. Trump for his personal engagement in bringing the conflict in Gaza to the end. But he said the aspirations of Palestinians for a state should not be overlooked.

“Genuine peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved without justice, justice for the Palestinian people, who have waited for decades for the creation of their independent state,” he said.

Many Council members, including France, Guyana, Pakistan, Slovenia and Somalia, had issues with the fact that the resolution did not include clear language on Palestinian statehood. But they said that they had endorsed the proposal to support the political momentum, prevent the resurgence of violence and allow much-needed humanitarian aid to flow into the enclave. They reiterated that the territorial integrity of Gaza must remain intact, and that lasting peace must be rooted in a two-state solution.

The language in the resolution about Palestinian statehood had drawn objections from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying on Sunday that “our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.”

Among the challenges the International Stabilization Force will face is how to confront Hamas’s fighters, who are still armed and present in Gaza. The resolution states that the force would be responsible for destroying military infrastructure in Gaza and decommissioning the militant groups’s weapons.

But Arab and Muslim countries expected to send soldiers to Gaza — Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates — are wary of their troops’ engaging in armed clashes with Palestinian militants and of any more bloodshed turning Arab public opinion against their involvement.

The Trump administration sought the mandate at the United Nations because those countries said they needed Security Council authorization so that their troops would not be viewed by their own populations as occupiers in Gaza.

Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said on Monday: “The demilitarization of Hamas is a basic condition of the peace agreement. There will be no future in Gaza as long as Hamas possesses weapons.”

The resolution went through multiple revisions in negotiations last week and faced significant pushback from many Council members, including Europeans, who demanded more clarity on Palestinian statehood and the Board of Peace.

At one point late last week, objections by China and Russia, which typically coordinate their positions around resolutions by the United States, threatened to derail the resolution altogether. Russia drafted its own 10-point counterresolution on Gaza, which called outright for Palestinian statehood and said the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza should be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.

After the vote, Russia and China said they had abstained from the vote because the resolution lacked clarity on key components and that the United States had not responded to multiple demands to provide more details on the Board of Peace and a two-state solution, and that Palestinian self-determination for postwar governance of the enclave was not fully reflected.

“Today is a sorrowful day for the Security Council,” Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, told the Council. He called the resolution “yet another pig in a poke” — something obtained without careful inspection first — and said the United States had gotten it through by “twisting the arms” of members of the Security Council.

The United States made minimal compromises on the resolution and instead rallied the support of the Arab and Muslim countries to pressure Russia and China not to be seen as obstacles to a breakthrough in Gaza. Diplomats said that Mr. Waltz had also warned the countries during negotiations that if the resolution failed, the cease-fire in Gaza would collapse.

The stakes were high for all the major actors. Palestinians want the suffering and the war to end. Israelis want Hamas disarmed. And the United States hoped to be the major player bringing peace to the region.

The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, welcomed the resolution, saying in a statement that it was an important step, and he encouraged all parties to abide by it. “It is essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,” he said

The resolution allows the World Bank, a U.N. entity, to allocate financial resources for the reconstruction of Gaza and calls for the establishment of a dedicated trust fund for this purpose.

It authorizes the Board of Peace to oversee Gaza at least until the end of 2027 and says that the enclave would be managed day-to-day by a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip.”

The stabilization force would also coordinate with Egypt and Israel to train and support Palestinian police personnel, protect civilians, work to secure humanitarian corridors and secure border areas.

Title: US-drafted resolution on Gaza contradicts decisions on establishing Palestinian state

Text: MOSCOW, November 18. /TASS/. The US-drafted resolution on the Gaza Strip that has been passed by the UN Security Council runs counter to the internationally recognized decision on the establishment of the State of Palestine, the Russian foreign ministry said.

"We have to state that resolution 2803 does not authorize the Security Council to maintain peace and security and runs counter to the spirit of real peacemaking, generally recognized legal decisions envisaging the establishment of an independent and territorially integrated State of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with a capital in Jerusalem, and co-existing in peace and security with Israel," the ministry said.

"The war and suffering of the enclave’s civilian population could have been ended long ago but for Washington’s systematical vetoing, six times in the past two years, draft resolutions demanding an immediate ceasefire," it emphasized.

The ministry slammed "enforced, in fact, ultimatum-like methods of pushing for the American draft, without proper discussion and due account of major amendments by other delegations, under direct threats of resuming a large-scale bloodshed in Gaza."

"Even such a measure as releasing a Russian counter-draft that was called to bridge the gaps within the UN Security Council by means of getting back to the consolidated fundamentals of the Palestinian-Israeli settlement on the basis of international law did not help improve the situation," it added.

UNSC resolution

The US-drafted resolution provides for the establishment of the so-called Board of Peace, which will oversee the governance of Gaza and which will be led by US President Donald Trump, involving, according to Trump some other authoritative world leaders. The Board will be authorized to deploy, in coordination with Israel and Egypt, an international stabilization force (SF) that will oversee the enclave’s demilitarization and disarming Hamas and other armed groups.

However, the Palestinian Authority will not take part in governing the enclave and determining Palestine’s future on the basis of the two-state solution, the ministry pointed out. The resolution is also mum about Israel’s commitment "as an occupying power to refuse from the annexation of Palestinian lands and withdraw its forces."

"The UN Security Council and Secretariat are completely factored out from the point of view of both control and accountability of the structures that are to be created in Gaza and practical modalities of the international contingent’s deployment," the Russian foreign ministry noted.

Russia’s position

Russia, according to the ministry, refrained from voting the resolution taking into account the position of the Palestinian Authority and Arab and Muslim countries in support for the US-proposed document and in an effort to avoid any recurrence of violence and hostilities in Gaza. The document was passed by 13 votes. China abstained along with Russia.

"The most important thing now is to ensure that this resolution is not used as a smokescreen to hide uncontrolled experiments in the occupied Palestinian territory, that it doesn’t turn into a definitive sentence to the Palestinians’ legitimate rights to self-determination and the Israelis’ aspirations for security and peaceful coexistence in the region," the ministry added.

Text: It has been cleared for publication that Aharon Cohen, 65, a veteran resident of Kiryat Arba, was murdered in the stabbing and ramming terror attack at the Gush Etzion Junction.

His funeral will depart at 21:00 from the eulogy hall in Industrial Zone A. He is survived by six children and grandchildren.

The Municipality of Kiryat Arba-Hebron released a statement: “The Kiryat Arba-Hebron community bows its head and shares in the grief of the Cohen family following the murder by evildoers of Aharon Cohen, may God avenge his blood, a resident of Kiryat Arba-Hebron and one of the city’s longtime members. On behalf of all the residents, we send our sincerest condolences to the dear family and embrace them warmly in this difficult hour.”

In the attack, a woman in her 40s was seriously wounded, and a man around 30 and a 15-year-old boy were moderately injured. They were evacuated to Shaare Zedek Medical Center and Hadassah Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The two terrorists, residents of the Palestinian town of Beit Ummar near Hebron, were eliminated at the scene.

A preliminary investigation found that the terrorists first attempted to run over pedestrians at the Gush Etzion Junction. They then exited their vehicle, pulled out knives, and stabbed passersby. Armed civilians and reservists from the IDF’s 7491 Battalion who identified the attackers opened fire. The IDF reported that several pipe bombs were found in the terrorists’ vehicle.

The head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council, Yaron Rosenthal, responded to the attack, criticizing the U.S.-backed UN Security Council resolution: “Once again, terror raises its head-less than 24 hours after the UN passed a resolution intended to eventually legitimize a Palestinian state, which would benefit those seeking to destroy us. It is time to act against terror in Judea and Samaria just as we have done in Gaza.”

The Yesha Council also responded: “When the State of Israel silently allows a ‘pathway to a Palestinian state,’ terror resurfaces. We have said all along: it is either sovereignty or a Palestinian state. The Israeli government avoided sovereignty, and we now face winds filling the sails of a terror state in the heart of our land. We call on the chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, MK Boaz Bismuth, to immediately advance the sovereignty bill that passed its preliminary reading and must now be urgently promoted in his committee.”

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee stated following the attack: "Terrorists murdered an innocent man - may his memory be a blessing - and injured several others in a vicious attack near Gush Etzion Junction today. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel and fully condemn these cowardly acts of savage violence. Janet and I pray for the victims and their families."

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., comments on Trump’s foreign policy agenda while he hosts the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’

President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that the U.S. will designate Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally, unveiling a defense and economic partnership with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a White House dinner marking 80 years of U.S.–Saudi relations.

Trump welcomed guests at the official dinner and thanked bin Salman for his visit and investment in the U.S. The crown prince gave brief remarks, thanking Trump and expressing his gratitude while saying he was looking forward to a continued partnership between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

Before announcing the new designation, Trump reflected on the nations’ long relationship, recalling a 1945 meeting between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz.

"It’s a special privilege to welcome his royal highness to Washington this year, as we mark the 80th anniversary of the first meeting between [a] U.S. President and a Saudi king," Trump said. "The two became immediate and warm friends … and right now you have the best friend you’ve ever had."

He added that ever since the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have been "enduring partners," they were "making that partnership closer and stronger than ever before" Tuesday night.

Trump said the partnership reached a new level after a day of meetings and signings with bin Salman. He praised Saudi Arabia’s modernization, calling it "an economic engine and a modern-day miracle," and said new agreements in energy, minerals and artificial intelligence were "unprecedented."

He added that Saudi Arabia had agreed to boost its investment in the U.S. from $600 billion to $1 trillion, a move he said would create American jobs and further strengthen the growing alliance.

"So, that’s why tonight I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, which is something that is very important to them," Trump said.

He added that both countries had just signed "a historic strategic defense agreement," calling it proof of "a stronger and more capable alliance" that would serve "the highest interest of peace."

The announcement followed Trump saying Saudi Arabia would invest $1 trillion in the U.S., doubling an earlier pledge.

"He said, ‘I am going to up that to $1 trillion,'" Trump told the audience. "So, he’s investing $1 trillion into the United States … and now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world."

Trump also pointed to what he called the largest arms purchase in history — $142 billion in American military equipment and services — and said the move "will mark and make both of our nations safer and cement the kingdom’s role as a key force for stability and security in the Middle East."

The president said the new defense pact would make both nations safer and referenced a recent U.S. military operation using B-2 bombers against what he described as an Iranian nuclear threat.

"Saudi Arabia has never been as safe as it is right now," he said. "You always had a little cloud over your head. … That cloud is not there anymore."

After the announcement, Trump tied the agreement to his broader Middle East peace agenda, citing the end of the war in Gaza, the return of hostages and a U.N. resolution endorsing his "Board of Peace" initiative.

"This is a board like no other," he said. "It will have the heads of major countries … and I was honored to be chosen the chair."

Bin Salman thanked Trump for the "warm and great welcome," calling the day "special" and emphasizing the growing economic relationship between the two countries.

The crown prince also said he believed this is a huge opportunity and vowed to remain focused on implementing and increasing opportunities between both countries.


Trump closed by saying the alliance marked the strongest moment in U.S.–Saudi relations since Roosevelt’s meeting with King Abdul Aziz.

"Someday, maybe we’ll talk about us as being two wonderful men," he said. "Forget about great — wonderful is OK — but two wonderful men that did tremendous work for their countries."
